However, robotic assembly still greatly relies on manual programming and performs in a highly controlled and structured environment in a repetitive manner with weak generalization. Recent successes in robot learning show that endowing robot intelligence to obtain skills autonomously is a promising approach. The existing robot learning methods are difficult to apply due to the requirement of sufficient trial-and-error exploration which is hardware-cost and time-consuming. When encountering an unfamiliar task, it is natural for human to use their prior knowledge as guidance to derive the explorative action and then leaning the related skills from the accumulated experience. Inspired by that, this paper proposes a knowledge-guided robot learning method with predictive model to improve the safety and efficiency of assembly skills acquisition. Concretely, based on Cartesian compliance control, a knowledge-guided exploration strategy (KGES) using the fuzzy logic about position/force feedback is built to provide direction and limit the range of exploration in the early learning stages. Upon KGES, a predictive model-based reinforcement learning method is proposed to optimize the local searching trajectory, where the training data, generated from the trained ensemble predictive models with a knowledge-guided branched progressive rollout method, is used for policy optimization. Finally, the proposed method is tested in two peg-in-hole assembly tasks in MuJoCo environment, and the results show that the robot can learn the assembly skill faster and perform better in success rate than model-free and knowledge-free settings while maintaining the contact force within a safe range.",Compliance control | Knowledge-guided robot learning | Model-based reinforcement learning | Robotic assembly | Smart manufacturing,0,0,,,NSFC,JCKY2020206B015,National Natural Science Foundation of China

The Context-oriented Programming (COP) paradigm posits a technique for the development of self-adaptive systems, capturing their main characteristics with specialized programming language constructs. In COP, adaptations are specified as independent modules that are composed in and out of the base system as contexts are activated and deactivated in response to sensed circumstances from the surrounding environment. However, the definition of adaptations, their contexts and associated specialized behavior, need to be specified at design time. In complex cyber–physical systems this is intractable, if not impossible, due to new unpredicted operating conditions arising. Objective: In this paper, we propose Auto-COP, a new technique to enable generation of adaptations at run time. Auto-COP uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) options to build action sequences, based on the previous instances of the system execution (for example, atomic system actions enacted by human operators). Options are further explored in interaction with the environment, and the most suitable options for each context are used to generate the adaptations, exploiting COP abstractions. Method: To validate Auto-COP, we present two case studies exhibiting different system characteristics and application domains: a driving assistant and a robot delivery system. We present examples of Auto-COP to illustrate the types of circumstances (contexts) requiring adaptation at run time, and the corresponding generated adaptations for each context. Results: We confirm that the generated adaptations exhibit correct system behavior measured by domain-specific performance metrics (e.g., conformance to specified speed limit), while reducing the number of required execution/actuation steps by a factor of two showing that the adaptations are regularly selected by the running system as adaptive behavior is more appropriate than the execution of atomic actions. Conclusion: Therefore, we demonstrate that Auto-COP is able to increase system adaptivity by enabling run-time generation of new adaptations for conditions detected at run time, while retaining the modularity offered by COP languages, and reducing the upfront specification required by system developers.",Context-oriented programming | Macro actions | Option learning | Reinforcement learning | Self-adaptive systems,0,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

These facts have motivated the development of a new middleware to meet the requirements of usability by non-experts. The proposed middleware is based on Android and is intended to be placed over existing robot SDKs and middleware. It runs on the android tablet of the Cruzr robot. Various toolings have been developed, such as a web component to control the robot via a webinterface, which facilitates its use. Methods: The middleware was developed using Android Java and runs on the Cruzr tablet as an app. It features a WebSocket server that interfaces with the robot and allows control via Python or other WebSocket-compatible languages. The speech interface utilizes Google Cloud Voice text-to-speech and speech-to-text services. The interface was implemented in Python, allowing for easy integration with existing robotics development workflows, and a web interface was developed for direct control of the robot via the web. Results: The new robot middleware was created and deployed on a Cruzr robot, relying on the WebSocket API and featuring a Python implementation. It supports various robot functions, such as text-to-speech, speech-to-text, navigation, displaying content and scanning bar codes. The system’s architecture allows for porting the interface to other robots and platforms, showcasing its adaptability.

The middleware was utilized to implement healthcare use cases and received good feedback. Conclusion: Cloud and local speech services were discussed in regard to the middleware’s needs, to run without having to change any code on other robots. An outlook on how the programming interface can further be simplified by using natural text to code generators has been/is given.

Existing methods like model predictive control often suffer from heavy online computational burdens. Reinforcement learning has shown promise in computer and board games but has yet to be widely adopted in industrial applications due to a lack of accessible, high-accuracy solvers. Current Reinforcement learning (RL) solvers are often developed for academic research and require a significant amount of theoretical knowledge and programming skills. Besides, many of them only support Python-based environments and limit to model-free algorithms. To address this gap, this paper develops General Optimal control Problems Solver (GOPS), an easy-to-use RL solver package that aims to build real-time and high-performance controllers in industrial fields. GOPS is built with a highly modular structure that retains a flexible framework for secondary development. Considering the diversity of industrial control tasks, GOPS also includes a conversion tool that allows for the use of Matlab/Simulink to support environment construction, controller design, and performance validation. To handle large-scale problems, GOPS can automatically create various serial and parallel trainers by flexibly combining embedded buffers and samplers. It offers a variety of common approximate functions for policy and value functions, including polynomial, multilayer perceptron, convolutional neural network, etc. Additionally, constrained and robust algorithms for special industrial control systems with state constraints and model uncertainties are also integrated into GOPS. Several examples, including linear quadratic control, inverted double pendulum, vehicle tracking, humanoid robot, obstacle avoidance, and active suspension control, are tested to verify the performances of GOPS.",Approximate dynamic programming | Benchmark | Industrial control | Neural network | Optimal control | Reinforcement learning,1,1,,,NSF,U20A20334,National Science Foundation

To overcome the above problems, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical path planner for unknown space exploration using RL-based intelligent frontier selection. Firstly, by decomposing the path planner into three-layered architecture (including the perception layer, planning layer, and control layer) and using edge detection to find potential frontiers to track, the path search space is shrunk from the whole map to a handful of points of interest, which significantly saves the computational resources in both training and execution processes. Secondly, one of the advanced RL algorithms, trust region policy optimization (TRPO), is used as a judge to select the best frontier for the robot to track, which ensures the optimality of the path planner with a shorter path length. The proposed method is validated through simulation and compared with both classic and state-of-the-art methods. Results show that the training process could be greatly accelerated compared with the traditional deep-Q network (DQN).

With the massive amount of data, the occurrence of network intrusion is also increasingly frequent, involving industrial control systems, IoT devices, mobile security, cloud services, and telecommunications services. With the diversification and intelligence of cyberattack behaviors, traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) face problems—such as insufficient feature extraction and inaccurate model classification—when faced with high-dimensional features and nonlinear massive data. Due to their powerful data representation learning ability, deep learning methods save substantial time in processing high-dimensional and complex intrusion data. On this basis, we propose an intrusion detection model using ResNet, Transformer and BiLSTM (Res-TranBiLSTM) that takes into account both the spatial and temporal features of network traffic. We use the Synthetic Minor Overriding Technique (SMOTE) – Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN) method to alleviate the degree of data imbalance. In addition, we respectively establish a spatial feature extraction model based on ResNet and a temporal feature extraction model based on Transformer and BiLSTM to extract spatial features and temporal features parallelly. Finally, spatiotemporal features are included to achieve attack detection and classification. Further, simulation experiments are conducted using the public data sets NSL-KDD and CIC-IDS2017. The experiments are implemented using Python programming language and Pytorch framework.

However, existing sampling-based algorithms still have problems of blind expansion and low efficiency. To solve these problems, a heuristic tomato-bunch harvest manipulator path planning method based on a 3D-CNN (convolution neural network)-based position posture map (PPM) and rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) is proposed in this paper. This method comprehensively considers the sampling effectiveness of the whole process of picking and harvesting, search speed, path cost and manipulability of the manipulator, combining a sampling-based path planning algorithm and deep learning framework. The method utilizes CNN and FCN (Fully Connected Neural Networks) for generating a heuristic cost map where each voxel has a cost-to-go value toward the target and an optimal target posture value to guide the expansion tree. In addition, the sampling space of obstacle avoidance planning is reduced by a spatial partition method, and the difficulty caused by the increase in the volume of the end-effector clamping fruit is solved by prioritizing the planning of the fruit harvest path and then planning the picking path. On the basis of the above research, a large number of harvest experiments have verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Research and experimental results show that, based on the PPM-RRT algorithm, the picking-harvest time of a single tomato bunch is 13 s, and the success rate is close to 100%. Compared with state-of-the-art sampling algorithms, the planning time is reduced by more than 70%, the path length is reduced by more than 24%, and the manipulability of the manipulator is increased by 38.9%.

LEAGUE leverages the symbolic interface of a task planner to guide RL-based skill learning and creates abstract state space to enable skill reuse. More importantly, LEAGUE learns manipulation skills in-situ of the task planning system, continuously growing its capability and the set of tasks that it can solve. We evaluate LEAGUE on four challenging simulated task domains and show that LEAGUE outperforms baselines by large margins. We also show that the learned skills can be reused to accelerate learning in new tasks domains and transfer to a physical robot platform.",continual learning | Reinforcement learning | task and motion planning,0,0,,,,undefined,

Object-shape transition models are essential to achieving automation by robots; however, learning such a complex model that depends on process conditions is challenging because it requires a significant amount of data, and the irreversible nature of the removal process makes data collection expensive. This letter proposes a cutting-surface-aware Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) method for robotic grinding. Our method employs a cutting-surface-aware model as the object's shape transition model, which in turn is composed of a geometric cutting model and a cutting-surface-deviation model, based on the assumption that the robot action can specify the cutting surface made by the tool. Furthermore, according to the grinding resistance theory, the cutting-surface-deviation model does not require raw shape information, making the model's dimensions smaller and easier to learn than a naive shape transition model directly mapping the shapes. Through evaluation and comparison by simulation and real robot experiments, we confirm that our MBRL method can achieve high data efficiency for learning object shaping by grinding and also provide generalization capability for initial and target shapes that differ from the training data.",Manipulation planning | model learning for control | reinforcement learning,0,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In addition to enhancing diagnostic outcomes, RUSS also holds the potential to provide medical interventions for populations suffering from the shortage of experienced sonographers. In this paper, we categorize RUSS as teleoperated or autonomous. Regarding teleoperated RUSS, we summarize their technical developments, and clinical evaluations, respectively. This survey then focuses on the review of recent work on autonomous robotic US imaging. We demonstrate that machine learning and artificial intelligence present the key techniques, which enable intelligent patient and process-specific, motion and deformation-aware robotic image acquisition. We also show that the research on artificial intelligence for autonomous RUSS has directed the research community toward understanding and modeling expert sonographers’ semantic reasoning and action. Here, we call this process, the recovery of the “language of sonography”. This side result of research on autonomous robotic US acquisitions could be considered as valuable and essential as the progress made in the robotic US examination itself. This article will provide both engineers and clinicians with a comprehensive understanding of RUSS by surveying underlying techniques.

The digitization of manufacturing is revolutionizing the future of this industry. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is bringing down the labor cost, reducing the machine downtime, and overall increasing the production speed. A new technological trend like Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses computer algorithms based on available data and can improve or decide further, automatically, based on experience, without the need for prior programming commands. ML can improve daily processes for identifying bottlenecks, developing products, controlling quality, providing security to the industry, and using AI robotics in place of humans. On one hand, technologies like ML, AI, IIoT, new materials, photonics, and rapid prototyping are driving the manufacturing sector in adopting a future version of Industry 4.0, and on the other hand, the European Commission (EC) has defined a roadmap until 2050 or more, in achieving the sustainable goal of carbon-neutrality and complete digitalization with resilience across the European continent. However, it is challenging to match the planned and actual roadmaps to the future of the technology-based manufacturing industry. There are uncertainties about how the future will be shaped by technologies in the EU manufacturing industry, in the changing political, environmental and social world environment. Recognizing these difficulties, the current article consults the available literature on this topic to determine the factors that will characterize the future of the manufacturing industry across EU countries. The relevant information about the EU manufacturing sectors has first been collected from various sources like Eurostat data, the EC policy documents, manufacturing company's annual reports, research reviews, journal articles, EU Industry Days annual event, etc. Then the collected data were analyzed to gain insight into the future of the technology-based EU manufacturing industry in the context of the European Commission's outlined policies. Variable factors from different manufacturing sectors are presented from different EU member states and scenario analysis was used for understanding the possible future. It is concluded that the future does not lie in adapting to the changing environment but in creating the future by EU companies themselves - revolution must be met by revolution. Their early experiences and path dependency can be seen as stubbornness, which may act as formidable barriers to building new capabilities. Therefore, companies must step-wise integrate resources to create a new process, and new structure, with personnel motivation, that fits with the broader European context in the coming decades.",Carbon-neutrality | Digitalization | EU | Management | Manufacturing,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,EDF,undefined,Google

FNPG-NH uses deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) based methods such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) to obtain a kinematically feasible path for a bevel-tipped flexible needle using a nonholonomic model. RL algorithms presented in this work generate the control input for needle rotation based on the rewards generated by the environment. The deep RL algorithms are trained on an environment that consists of 1) ventricles segmented from T1 images of the healthy volunteers using atlas-based segmentation, 2) blood vessels segmented from MRA volumes of the same volunteer using thresholding, and 3) tumor volume from labeled BraTS 2020 dataset and placed at an anatomically relevant location. The paths generated by the reinforcement learning algorithm and the traditional sampling-based algorithm RRT are compared for various performance metrics. The reinforcement learning model was trained on 20 volumes and validated on 68 volumes, and RRT was evaluated on the same 68 validation volumes.

To date, the application of deep-learning techniques in independent portable brain-computer-interface (BCI) devices has not been extensively explored. In this study, we proposed a high-accuracy MI EEG decoder by incorporating spatial-attention mechanism into convolution neural network (CNN), and deployed it on fully integrated single-chip microcontroller unit (MCU). After the CNN model was trained on workstation computer using GigaDB MI datasets (52 subjects), its parameters were then extracted and converted to build deep-learning architecture interpreter on MCU. For comparison, EEG-Inception model was also trained using the same dataset, and was deployed on MCU. The results indicate that our deep-learning model can independently decode imaginary left-/right-hand motions. The mean accuracy of the proposed compact CNN reaches 96.75 ± 2.41% (8 channels: Frontocentral3 (FC3), FC4, Central1 (C1), C2, Central-Parietal1 (CP1), CP2, C3, and C4), versus 76.96 ± 19.08% of EEG-Inception (6 channels: FC3, FC4, C1, C2, CP1, and CP2). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first portable deep-learning decoder for MI EEG signals. The findings demonstrate high-accuracy deep-learning decoding of MI EEG in a portable mode, which has great implications for hand-disabled patients. Our portable system can be used for developing artificial-intelligent wearable BCI devices, as it is less computationally expensive and convenient for real-life application.

The results suggest that specialists agree on the importance of including a mixture of theoretical and applied topics in the syllabus but prefer practical skills over fundamental concepts. Besides learning from defeaturing to postprocessing a model, engineering students must know how to plan, verify, and validate their finite element studies. Experts expect early design engineers to be proficient with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and have relevant mathematical and programming skills. Instead of using specialized software, students' first exposure to FEM may be based on FEA tools embedded in CAD systems. Also, academic and industrial respondents request the incorporation of modal, thermal and nonlinear analysis procedures in the course timetable. Finally, the statistical analysis shows that the two types of respondents share one common vision about the importance of the aspects under study.

In applied disciplines such as fluid power (FP), hands-on lab experiences constitute an essential component for educating future engineers at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. Physical hydraulic trainers have been developed over the years to expose students to applications of modern FP technology. However, there is a notable absence of virtual tools that can provide students with a realistic feeling of assembling, troubleshooting, and operating an actual hydraulic circuit. This paper describes the effort made to develop an original virtual trainer that fulfills these needs. This virtual trainer is designed to replicate existing physical trainers that were recently designed and implemented for FP education but on a virtual platform. The virtual trainer is implemented in Unity3D software, using CAD drawings of the components from the actual trainer, and provides the user with an interactive environment that reproduces all the aspects of a real lab experience. The tool allows the students to learn by mistake, as in typical activities with a physical trainer and includes realistic operating noise. The core part of the virtual trainer is the object-oriented simulation model that is behind every hydraulic component. First successfully used in the Fall of 2020, and subsequently utilized in both Spring and Fall 2021 courses, the simulator represents an alternative for hands-on experiences, and could be a valid option for distance learning students in the future.

A significant part of this course involves having the students learn how to program the movement of a robotic arm by controlling the velocity of its individual joint motors, a topic referred to as joint programming. They must learn how to develop algorithms to move the end effector of the arm by controlling the instantaneous velocity or some similar aspect, of each joint motor. To support this learning activity, physical or virtual robotic arms are typically employed. Visual observation of the movement of the arm provides feedback to the correctness of the student’s joint programming algorithms. A problem arises with supporting the student in learning how to move the robotic arm with precise velocity along some path, a subtopic of joint programming referred to as differential movements. To develop this knowledge, the student must produce and test differential movement algorithms and have the capability to verify its correctness. Regardless of the type of arm used, physical or virtual, the human eye cannot notice the difference between a correct or incorrect movement of the end effector as this will involve noticing small differences in velocities. This study found that by simulating the process of spray painting on a virtual canvas, the correctness of a differential movement algorithm may be accessed by observing the resulting paint on the canvas as opposed to observing the movement of the arm. A model of a set of spray-painting equipment and a canvas was added to an existing virtual robotic arm educational tool and used in an Introduction to Robotics class offered at Florida Gulf Coast University in Spring 2019 and Spring 2020. The class offered in Spring 2019 used the virtual arm but without the spray-painting feature while the class offered in Spring 2020 used the new spray-painting feature that was added to the virtual arm. Exam results show that 59.4% of the students that used the new feature scored at least an 85% on the corresponding differential movements exam question compared to only 5.6% of the class that did not use the added spray-painting feature.

NFV emerges as a promising technology to provide flexible services by orchestrating different virtual Network Function Chains (vNFCs). However, the vNFC deployment process is complex and involves two stages, i.e., allocating diverse Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) onto different physical nodes and routing suitable paths for Virtual Links (VLs). How to coordinate the above two stages to deploy vNFCs efficiently in EONs for cloud-edge computing is extremely important. Previous vNFC deployment algorithms are heuristic policies that disregard heterogeneous characteristics in cloud-edge computing. Recently, single-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can provide adaptive allocation schemes by perceptual learning from the environment. Whereas, its performance is not as good as expected since it makes the process of VFNs deployment and VLs deployment independent. Therefore, we propose a Double-Agent Reinforced vNFC Deployment algorithm (DARD) to integrate the VNFs and VLs deployment stages by two cooperative DRL agents. Additionally, we formulate the vNFC deployment problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to achieve optimal solutions.

The study focused on the situation when operators with no programming skills have to accomplish teleoperated tasks dealing with randomly localized different-sized objects in an unstructured environment. The purpose of this study is to reduce stress on operators, increase accuracy and reduce the time of task accomplishment. The special application of the proposed system is in the radioactive isotope production factories. The following approach combined the reactivity of the operator’s direct control with the powerful tools of vision-based object classification and localization. Design/methodology/approach: Perceptive real-time gesture control predicated on a Kinect sensor is formulated by information fusion between human intuitiveness and an augmented reality-based vision algorithm. Objects are localized using a developed feature-based vision algorithm, where the homography is estimated and Perspective-n-Point problem is solved. The 3D object position and orientation are stored in the robot end-effector memory for the last mission adjusting and waiting for a gesture control signal to autonomously pick/place an object. Object classification process is done using a one-shot Siamese neural network (NN) to train a proposed deep NN; other well-known models are also used in a comparison. The system was contextualized in one of the nuclear industry applications: radioactive isotope production and its validation were performed through a user study where 10 participants of different backgrounds are involved. Findings: The system was contextualized in one of the nuclear industry applications: radioactive isotope production and its validation were performed through a user study where 10 participants of different backgrounds are involved. The results revealed the effectiveness of the proposed teleoperation system and demonstrate its potential for use by robotics non-experienced users to effectively accomplish remote robot tasks.

Originality/value: The contribution and uniqueness of the presented study are represented in the development of a well-integrated HRI system that can tackle the four aforementioned circumstances in an effective and user-friendly way. High operator–robot reactivity is kept by using the direct control method, while a lot of cognitive stress is removed using elective/flapped autonomous mode to manipulate randomly localized different configuration objects.

Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning has been introduced to solve the partially observable variant of MAPF by learning a decentralized single-agent policy in a centralized fashion based on each agent's partial observation. However, existing learning-based methods are ineffective in achieving complex multi-agent cooperation, especially in congested environments, due to the non-stationarity of this setting. To tackle this challenge, we propose a multi-agent actor-critic method called Soft Actor-Critic with Heuristic-Based Attention (SACHA), which employs novel heuristic-based attention mechanisms for both the actors and critics to encourage cooperation among agents. SACHA learns a neural network for each agent to selectively pay attention to the shortest path heuristic guidance from multiple agents within its field of view, thereby allowing for more scalable learning of cooperation. SACHA also extends the existing multi-agent actor-critic framework by introducing a novel critic centered on each agent to approximate Q-values. Compared to existing methods that use a fully observable critic, our agent-centered multi-agent actor-critic method results in more impartial credit assignment and better generalizability of the learned policy to MAPF instances with varying numbers of agents and types of environments. We also implement SACHA(C), which embeds a communication module in the agent's policy network to enable information exchange among agents. We evaluate both SACHA and SACHA(C) on a variety of MAPF instances and demonstrate decent improvements over several state-of-the-art learning-based MAPF methods with respect to success rate and solution quality.",deep learning methods | Path planning for multiple mobile robots or agents | reinforcement learning,0,0,repositoryam,Green,NSERC,RGPIN2020-06540,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

However, most existing automaton based algorithms highly rely on the manually customized representation of states for the considered task, limiting its applicability in deep reinforcement learning algorithms. To address this issue, by incorporating Transformer into reinforcement learning, we develop a Double-Transformer-guided Temporal Logic framework (T2TL) that exploits the structural feature of Transformer twice, i.e., first encoding the LTL instruction via the Transformer module for efficient understanding of task instructions during the training and then encoding the context variable via the Transformer again for improved task performance. Particularly, the LTL instruction is specified by co-safe LTL. As a semantics-preserving rewriting operation, LTL progression is exploited to decompose the complex task into learnable sub-goals, which not only converts non-Markovian reward decision processes to Markovian ones, but also improves the sampling efficiency by simultaneous learning of multiple sub-tasks. An environment-agnostic LTL pre-training scheme is further incorporated to facilitate the learning of the Transformer module resulting in an improved representation of LTL. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the T2TL framework.",Linear temporal logic | motion planning | reinforcement learning,0,0,repositoryam,Green,NSFC,62173314,National Natural Science Foundation of China

As navigation through lumens and vessels is quite complex, interest grows to establish autonomous navigation techniques for IP and EI for reaching the target area.

Through a systematic literature analysis using the PRISMA method, the study summarizes relevant works and investigates the clinical aim, LoA, adopted MP techniques, and validation types. We identify the limitations of the corresponding MP methods and provide directions to improve the robustness of the algorithms in dynamic intraluminal environments.

In fact, RIG can plan paths for robots with several degrees of freedom and rapidly explore complex workspaces by using the state-of-the-art Voronoi-biased expansion.

In ICNN-LSTM, the WT decomposes the signal and extracts time and frequency domain information, while the MGGP filters out redundant information. Then, the CNN and LSTM are integrated in a parallel and loosely coupled manner to form an initial combined model CNN-LSTM (CNN combined with LSTM) to process filtered information by WT and MGGP. Furthermore, this study compares the performance of ICNN-LSTM with CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, ICNN (CNN embedded with WT and MGGP), ILSTM (LSTM embedded with WT and MGGP), artificial neural network (ANN), and the traditional sediment rating curve (SRC). The evaluation of prediction accuracy for all models was conducted using root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSC), coefficient of determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE) as performance indicators. The daily discharge and suspended sediment concentration series data from Tangnaihai Hydrological Station in the upper reaches of the Yellow River spanning from 1977 to 1987 were selected to train and test the models.

In particular, we propose: 1) learning a residual IDs model using the Gaussian Process and linearizing it so that it can be incorporated inside the QP-control optimization procedure and 2) a novel combination of adaptive control and QP-based methods to avoid the manual tuning of end-effector PID controllers and faster convergence in learning the residual dynamics model.

We train our approach on synthetic data with domain randomization and demonstrate its successful execution via sim-to-real transfer in reconstructing narrow, covered, real-world cabinet environments cluttered with unknown objects. The natural cabinet scenarios impose significant challenges for robot motion and scene reconstruction due to surrounding obstacles and low ambient lighting conditions. However, despite unfavorable settings, our method exhibits high performance compared to its baselines in terms of various environment reconstruction metrics, including planning speed, the number of viewpoints, and overall scene coverage.",Active sensing | deep learning | planning and control | scene reconstruction | unknown environments,0,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The policy uses a unique combination of input data to generate the desired steering angle and forward velocity: a short history of lidar data, kinematic data about nearby pedestrians, and a subgoal point. The policy is trained in a reinforcement learning setting using a reward function that contains a novel term based on velocity obstacles to guide the robot to actively avoid pedestrians and move toward the goal. Through a series of 3-D simulated experiments with up to 55 pedestrians, this control policy is able to achieve a better balance between collision avoidance and speed (i.e., higher success rate and faster average speed) than state-of-the-art model-based and learning-based policies, and it also generalizes better to different crowd sizes and unseen environments. An extensive series of hardware experiments demonstrate the ability of this policy to directly work in different real-world environments with different crowd sizes with zero retraining. Furthermore, a series of simulated and hardware experiments show that the control policy also works in highly constrained static environments on a different robot platform without any additional training.

In attempting to acquire a satisfactory DRL-based motion planning strategy, the mobile robots encountered several difficulties, including poor convergence, insufficient sample information, and low learning efficiency. These problems not only consume plenty of training time, but also bring a negative impact on motion planning performance. One promising research direction is to provide a more effective network framework for DRL-based policies. Along this line of thinking, our paper presents a novel DRL-based motion planning approach called Reconfigurable Structure of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (RS-DDPG) for mobile robots. To account for the poor convergence, the proposed approach first introduces an event-triggered reconfigurable actor–critic network framework for motion policy that adaptively changes its network structure to suppress the overestimation of action value. Then, the time convergence of the motion policy can be enhanced based on the value actions with minor valuation deviation. Afterwards, an adaptive reward mechanism is designed for reconfigurable networks to compensate for the lack of sample information. To deal with the problem of low learning efficiency, we developed a sample pretreatment method for the experience samples, which employs three novel techniques to improve the sample utilization, including a double experience memory buffer, a variable proportional sampling principle, and a similarity judgment mechanism. In extensive experiments, the proposed method outperforms the compared approaches.",Actor–critic | Event-triggered | Mobile robot | Reconfigurable structure | Reinforcement learning | Sample pretreatment,0,0,,,NSFC,QN2021312,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Current studies on skill learning in robot polishing are mainly about trajectory skills, and force-relevant skills learning models are less studied.

In this study, a force-relevant skills learning method called arc-length probabilistic movement primitives (AL-ProMP) is proposed to improve the efficiency of robot polishing force planning. AL-ProMP learns the mapping between the contact force and polishing trajectory, and the temporal scaling factor and force scaling factor in AL-ProMP enable better robustness of force planning in speed scaling tasks and polishing tasks in different scenarios. Speed scaling is an important property for adaptation of the polishing policy. For the generalization of polishing skills to different polishing tools in robotics disc polishing tasks of unknown geometric model workpieces, a novel force scaling factor for different polishing discs is proposed according to the contact force model.

The goal is to take inspiration from the way humans dynamically and autonomously adapt their behavior according to variations in their own performance while minimizing cognitive effort. Following computational neuroscience principles, the architecture combines model-based (MB) and model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL). The main novelty here consists in arbitrating with a meta-controller which selects the current learning strategy according to a trade-off between efficiency and computational cost. The MB strategy, which builds a model of the long-term effects of actions and uses this model to decide through dynamic programming, enables flexible adaptation to task changes at the expense of high computation costs. The MF strategy is less flexible but also 1000 times less costly, and learns by observation of MB decisions. We test the architecture in three experiments: a navigation task in a real environment with task changes (wall configuration changes, goal location changes); a simulated object manipulation task under human teaching signals; and a simulated human–robot cooperation task to tidy up objects on a table. We show that our human-inspired strategy coordination method enables the robot to maintain an optimal performance in terms of reward and computational cost compared to an MB expert alone, which achieves the best performance but has the highest computational cost. We also show that the method makes it possible to cope with sudden changes in the environment, goal changes or changes in the behavior of the human partner during interaction tasks.

We leverage the capability of deep RL from indirect supervision as a direct nonlinear optimizer, and the parameters of the policy network are updated by proximal policy optimization. We treat the routing topology as a network graph, so we utilize a graph convolutional network to embed the features into the policy network. One step size environment is designed, so all cores are placed simultaneously. To handle large dimensional action space, we use continuous values matching with the number of cores as the output of the policy network and discretize them again for obtaining the new placement. For multichip system mapping, we developed a community detection algorithm. We use several datasets of multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural networks to evaluate our agent. We compare the optimal results obtained by our agent with other baselines under different multicast conditions. Our approach achieves a significant reduction of routing runtime, communication cost, and average traffic load, along with deadlock-free performance for inner chip data transmission.

A necessary effort in this endeavor is presented in this paper: the development and evaluation of a mission supervisor utilized to control the mission and behavior of a full-scale autonomous forest regeneration machine tested in realistic environments.

A terrain machine built as a research platform with an added full-scale forwarder crane is used as a base machine. First, we describe the scenario in which planting is conducted, whereupon we develop the composite tasks required as states.

Understanding the emotional state of children with ASD is crucial for providing personalized interventions and support. Existing methods often rely on controlled lab environments, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. Hence, a framework that enables the recognition of affective states in children with ASD in uncontrolled settings is needed. This paper presents a framework for recognizing the affective state of children with ASD in an in-the-wild setting using heart rate (HR) information. More specifically, an algorithm is developed that can classify a participant’s emotion as positive, negative, or neutral by analyzing the heart rate signal acquired from a smartwatch. The heart rate data are obtained in real time using a smartwatch application while the child learns to code a robot and interacts with an avatar. The avatar assists the child in developing communication skills and programming the robot. In this paper, we also present a semi-automated annotation technique based on facial expression recognition for the heart rate data. The HR signal is analyzed to extract features that capture the emotional state of the child. Additionally, in this paper, the performance of a raw HR-signal-based emotion classification algorithm is compared with a classification approach based on features extracted from HR signals using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art HR-based emotion recognition techniques, despite being conducted in an uncontrolled setting rather than a controlled lab environment. The framework presented in this paper contributes to the real-world affect analysis of children with ASD using HR information. By enabling emotion recognition in uncontrolled settings, this approach has the potential to improve the monitoring and understanding of the emotional well-being of children with ASD in their daily lives.",autism spectrum disorder (ASD) | emotion recognition | heart rate | smart bracelet | wearable,0,1,repositoryam,Green,NSF,2114808,National Science Foundation

To make such tools applicable for ego-centric planning with only local information, we propose an adaptive model-predictive game solver, which jointly infers other players' objectives online and computes a corresponding generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) strategy. The adaptivity of our approach is enabled by a differentiable trajectory game solver whose gradient signal is used for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of opponents' objectives. This differentiability of our pipeline facilitates direct integration with other differentiable elements, such as neural networks (NNs). Furthermore, in contrast to existing solvers for cost inference in games, our method handles not only partial state observations but also general inequality constraints.

Specifically, a re-configurable simulator for assembly planning is developed based on a Building Information Model (BIM) and an open game engine, which could support the training and testing of various optimization methods. Furthermore, the assembly planning problem is modelled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and a set of DRL algorithms are developed and trained using the simulator. Finally, experimental case studies in four typical scenarios are conducted, and the performance of our proposed methods have been verified, which can also serve as benchmarks for future research works within the community of automated construction. Note to Practitioners - This paper is conducted based on the comprehensive analysis of real-life assembly planning processes in prefabricated construction, and the methods proposed could bring many benefits to practitioners. Firstly, the proposed simulator could be easily re-configured to simulate diverse scenarios, which can be used to evaluate and verify the operations' optimization methods and new construction technologies. Secondly, the proposed DRL-based optimization methods can be directly adopted in various robot-based construction scenarios, and can also be tailored to support the assembly planning in traditional human-based or human-robot construction environments. Thirdly, the proposed DRL methods and their performance in the four typical scenarios can serve as benchmarks for proposing new advanced construction technologies and optimization methods in assembly planning.",assembly planning | automated construction | building information modelling (BIM) | deep reinforcement learning (DRL) | Prefabricated construction,3,0,,,NSFC,72174042,National Natural Science Foundation of China

However, there is a lack of review to understand how AI teaching and learning (AITL) research looks like over the past two decades to provide the research basis for AI literacy education. To summarize the empirical findings from the literature, this systematic literature review conducts a thematic and content analysis of 49 publications from 2000 to 2020 to pave the way for recent AI literacy education. The related pedagogical models, teaching tools and challenges identified help set the stage for today’s AI literacy. The results show that AITL focused more on computer science education at the university level before 2021. Teaching AI had not become popular in K-12 classrooms at that time due to a lack of age-appropriate teaching tools for scaffolding support. However, the pedagogies learnt from the review are valuable for educators to reflect how they should develop students’ AI literacy today. Educators have adopted collaborative project-based learning approaches, featuring activities like software development, problem-solving, tinkering with robots, and using game elements. However, most of the activities require programming prerequisites and are not ready to scaffold students’ AI understandings. With suitable teaching tools and pedagogical support in recent years, teaching AI shifts from technology-oriented to interdisciplinary design. Moreover, global initiatives have started to include AI literacy in the latest educational standards and strategic initiatives. These findings provide a research foundation to inform educators and researchers the growth of AI literacy education that can help them to design pedagogical strategies and curricula that use suitable technologies to better prepare students to become responsible educated citizens for today’s growing AI economy.",AI literacy | AI teaching and learning | Pedagogy | Systematic review | Teaching tools,3,0,,,,undefined,

First, an overall task is divided into multiple simpler subtasks that are more appropriate for learning and control objectives. Then, by collecting human demonstrations, the subtasks that require robot movement are modeled by probabilistic movement primitives (ProMPs). We also study two strategies for modifying the ProMPs to avoid collisions with environmental obstacles. Finally, we introduce a rule-base control technique by utilizing a finite-state machine along with a unique means of control design for ProMPs. For the ProMP controller, we propose control barrier and Lyapunov functions to guide the system along a trajectory within the distribution defined by a ProMP while guaranteeing that the system state never leaves more than a desired distance from the distribution mean. This allows for better performance on nonlinear systems and offers solid stability and known bounds on the system state. A series of simulations and experimental studies demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and show that it can run in real time. Note to Practitioners - This paper is motivated by the need to create a teach-by-demonstration framework that captures the strengths of movement primitives and verifiable, safe control. We provide a framework that learns safe control laws from a probability distribution of robot trajectories through the use of advanced nonlinear control that incorporates safety constraints. Typically, such distributions are stochastic, making it difficult to offer any guarantees on safe operation. Our approach ensures that the distribution of allowed robot trajectories is within an envelope of safety and allows for robust operation of a robot. Furthermore, using our framework various probability distributions can be combined to represent complex scenarios in the environment. It will benefit practitioners by making it substantially easier to test and deploy accurate, efficient, and safe robots in complex real-world scenarios. The approach is currently limited to scenarios involving static obstacles, with dynamic obstacle avoidance an avenue of future effort.",learning from demonstration | motion and path planning | Motion control | optimization and optimal control | robot safety,1,0,,,NSF,1746052,National Science Foundation

They can be used for aerial manipulation tasks such as object retrieval from confined and hard-to-reach spaces. The coupled dynamics between the arm and the base and also the limited flight time would require the development and implementation of optimal motion planning and robust flight control strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel integrated planning and control strategy for object retrieval. A new kinodynamic version of the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT∗), called Lazy-Steering-RRT∗, is developed for planning UAM's motion from its start to a pre-grasp state, while keeping the motion of the arm to a minimum. This planning can be carried out on the fly by using Machine-Learning-based techniques to construct the edges in the search tree in a time-efficient way. This facilitates re-planning, as the environment is gradually sensed by limited-range sensors onboard. Once the UAM reaches the pre-grasp state at the end of the motion cycle, an RRT approach is then utilized, where motions of the base and the arm are coordinated for reaching and grasping the object. A novel partitioned control approach, composed of model predictive and PID controllers, is utilized for the UAM to track the planned trajectory. The overall motion planning and control algorithms have been implemented in simulation using Multibody Physics Engines and a number of representative simulation runs are presented. Our results show that the approach is effective in successfully executing the object retrieval task even in confined spaces. Note to Practitioners-This research was motivated by the problem of retrieving an object from a confined space such as that in a collapsed building using an unmanned aerial manipulator. Our approach has the following advantages over existing methods: a) Planning and re-planning can be carried out on the fly, b) No prior information about the environment is needed, c) High-frequency energy-optimal control of the UAM is carried out, and d) the planner and the controller are coupled. In this paper, we suggest some novel approaches on both planning and control aspects of the navigation and also on the integration of these two modules to provide a navigation package that meets all the requirements in the retrieval task. Furthermore, our algorithm is computationally-light, therefore, well suited for on the fly planning and control.",Autonomous aerial manipulators | model predictive control | motion planning | object rertieval,1,0,,,,undefined,

The real underwater environment is large-scale, complex, real-time and dynamic, and many unknown obstacles may exist in the underwater environment. Under such complex conditions and lack of prior knowledge, the existing path planning methods are difficult to plan, therefore they cannot effectively meet the actual demands. In response to these problems, a three-dimensional marine environment including multiple obstacles is established with the real ocean current data in this paper, which is consistent with the actual application scenarios. Then, we propose an N-step Priority Double DQN (NPDDQN) path planning algorithm, which potently realizes obstacle avoidance in the complex environment. In addition, this study proposes an experience screening mechanism, which screens the explored positive experience and improves its reuse rate, thus efficiently improving the algorithm stability in the dynamic environment. This paper verifies the better performance of reinforcement learning compared with a variety of traditional methods in three-dimensional underwater path planning. Underwater robots based on the proposed method have good autonomy and stability, which provides a new method for path planning of underwater robots. Note to Practitioners-The goal of this study is to provide a new solution for obstacle avoidance in path planning of underwater robots, which is consistent with the dynamic and real-time demands of the real environment. Existing underwater path planning researches lack a consistent environment with the actual application, and therefore we firstly construct a three-dimensional ocean environment with real ocean current data to provide support for the algorithms. Additionally, most of the algorithms are pre-planning methods or require long-time calculation, and there is little research on obstacle avoidance. In the face of obstacle changes, underwater robots with poor adaptability will cause performance decline and even economic losses. The proposed algorithm learns through interaction with the environment, and therefore it does not require any prior experience, and has good adaptability as well as fast inference speed. Especially, in the dynamic environment, algorithm performance is difficult to guarantee due to less positive experience in exploration. The proposed experience screening mechanism improves the stability of the algorithm, so that the underwater robot maintains stable performance in different dynamic environments.",obstacle avoidance | path planning | Reinforcement learning | underwater robot,4,0,,,NSFC,61871283,National Natural Science Foundation of China

For this purpose, a spatial iterative learning control (sILC) is developed to learn an accurate path through intuitive online correction based on human-robot interaction (HRI). To improve the efficiency and accuracy of the path learning, a visual assistance system is added to HRI, which helps the robot to find the initial path point and complement the correction of the learning error. This method mitigates the requirement on classic ILC that the time period should be consistent in the repetitive interaction task and utilizes the complementary advantages of vision and force sensing, thus addressing the limitations of the vision-based or HRI methods. The rigorous proof of learning convergence and the results of the simulation and experiments on a 7-degree-of-freedom (DoF) Sawyer robot platform illustrate the significance and advantages of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners - The problem of accurate path learning of robotic manipulators is addressed in this paper, which is found in ample applications such as welding and laser cutting. When the required path is irregular, it is difficult to define it based on offline programming and calibration. This paper presents a new human-robot interactive learning framework, in which the interaction force and machine vision are combined with sILC to achieve online detection and correction for learning and tracking an unknown path.

Especially for students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented at university level, positive experiences at high-school can be an important factor for their future academic choices. In this paper we report on a hands-on programming workshop that we ran over multiple sessions for Maori and Pasifika high-school students who are underrepresented in computer science at the tertiary level in New Zealand. In the workshop, participants developed Scratch programs starting from a simple template we provided. In order to control the action in their programs, half of the participants used standard mouse and keyboard inputs, and the other half had access to plug-and-play sensors that provided real-time environmental data. We explore how students' perceptions of self-efficacy and outcome expectancy - both key constructs driving academic career choices - changed during the workshop and how these were impacted by the availability of the sensor toolkit.

In this work, we propose an algorithm for learning predicates from demonstrations, eliminating the need for manually specified state abstractions. Our key idea is to learn predicates by optimizing a surrogate objective that is tractable but faithful to our real efficient-planning objective. We use this surrogate objective in a hill-climbing search over predicate sets drawn from a grammar.

This approach, however, lacks flexibility, which limits their applicability in diverse and dynamic workloads. Recently, a new type of programmable packet processor, which uses high-level languages, e.g., P4, has emerged as a possible candidate. P4-based switches, however, fall short in certain applications, including machine learning, where capabilities not currently supported by P4 are needed. These include more complex calculation, such as sparse computation and fused multiply-accumulate, data-intensive floating point operations, data reuse, and significant memory. The problem addressed here is that such a switch augmentation needs to support: a large amount of state, significant flexible compute capability, and ease of programming, all while maintaining full functionality, including ensuring high throughput, and demonstrating utility.In this work, we propose a programmable look-aside-type accelerator that can be embedded into, or attached to, existing communication switch pipelines and that is capable of processing packets at line rate. The proposed in-switch accelerator is based on mixing an ISA (subset of RISC-V instructions) with dataflow graphs (found in CGRAs). To augment performance, vector instructions are also supported. To facilitate usability, we have developed a complete toolchain to compile user-provided C/C codes to appropriate back-end instructions for configuring the accelerator.

More than 90% of computation time in motion planning is spent on collision detection between the robot and the environment. Several motion planning approaches, such as deep learning-based motion planning, have shown significant improvements in motion planning quality and runtime with ample parallelism available in collision detection. However, naive parallelization of collision detection queries significantly increases computation compared to sequential execution. In this work, we investigate the sources of redundant computations in coarse-grained (inter-collision detection) and fine-grained (intra-collision detection) parallelism. We find that the physical spatial locality of obstacles results in redundant computation in coarse-grained parallelism. We further show that the primary sources of redundant computation in fine-grained parallelism are easy cases where objects are far apart or significantly overlapping. Based on these insights, we propose MPAccel to improve the energy efficiency of parallelization in motion planning. MPAccel consists of SAS, a Spatially Aware Scheduler for coarse-grained parallelism, and CECDUs, Cascaded Early-exit Collision Detection Units for fine-grained parallelism.

The program uses manually scored crystallization trials deposited in a database of an in-house crystallization robot as a training set. Since the success rate of such a system is able to catch up with manual inspection by trained persons, it will become an important tool for crystallographers working on biological samples. Four network architectures were compared and the SqueezeNet architecture performed best. In detecting crystals AlexNet accomplished a better result, but with a lower threshold the mean value for crystal detection was improved for SqueezeNet. Two assumptions were made about the imaging rate. With these two extremes it was found that an image processing rate of at least two times, but up to 58 times in the worst case, would be needed to reach the maximum imaging rate according to the deep learning network architecture employed for real-time classification. To avoid high workloads for the control computer of the CrystalMation system, the computing is distributed over several workstations, participating voluntarily, by the grid programming system from the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC).

Researchers strive to address this nonlinear problem and have achieved remarkable results through the implementation of the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm DQN (Deep Q-Network). However, persistent challenges remain, including the curse of dimensionality, difficulties of model convergence and sparsity in rewards. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes an enhanced DDQN (Double DQN) path planning approach, in which the information after dimensionality reduction is fed into a two-branch network that incorporates expert knowledge and an optimized reward function to guide the training process. The data generated during the training phase are initially discretized into corresponding low-dimensional spaces. An “expert experience” module is introduced to facilitate the model’s early-stage training acceleration in the Epsilon–Greedy algorithm. To tackle navigation and obstacle avoidance separately, a dual-branch network structure is presented. We further optimize the reward function enabling intelligent agents to receive prompt feedback from the environment after performing each action.

We first describe these modules and highlight the key challenges pertaining to each one. We then present an artificial neural network for automatic fish tracking. The network detected fish successfully in 85% of the frames, and in these frames, its average pose estimation error was less than 0.04 body lengths. We finally demonstrate how the framework works through a case study focusing on a cue-based navigation task. Two low-level perception–action controllers were generated through the framework. Their performance was measured using two-dimensional particle simulations and compared against two benchmark controllers, which were programmed manually by a researcher. The fish-inspired controllers had excellent performance when the robot was started from the initial conditions used in fish demonstrations (>96% success rate), outperforming the benchmark controllers by at least 3%. One of them also had an excellent generalisation performance when the robot was started from random initial conditions covering a wider range of starting positions and heading angles (>98% success rate), again outperforming the benchmark controllers by 12%.

One approach to engage and inspire students from a variety of backgrounds is the use of educational robots. Unfortunately, previous research presents mixed results on the effectiveness of educational robots on student learning. One possibility for this lack of clarity may be because students have a wide variety of styles of learning. It is possible that the use of kinesthetic feedback, in addition to the normally used visual feedback, may improve learning with educational robots by providing a richer, multi-modal experience that may appeal to a larger number of students with different learning styles. It is also possible, however, that the addition of kinesthetic feedback, and how it may interfere with the visual feedback, may decrease a student’s ability to interpret the program commands being executed by a robot, which is critical for program debugging. In this work, we investigated whether human participants were able to accurately determine a sequence of program commands performed by a robot when both kinesthetic and visual feedback were being used together. Command recall and end point location determination were compared to the typically used visual-only method, as well as a narrative description. Results from 10 sighted participants indicated that individuals were able to accurately determine a sequence of movement commands and their magnitude when using combined kinesthetic + visual feedback. Participants’ recall accuracy of program commands was actually better with kinesthetic + visual feedback than just visual feedback. Although the recall accuracy was even better with the narrative description, this was primarily due to participants confusing an absolute rotation command with a relative rotation command with the kinesthetic + visual feedback. Participants’ zone location accuracy of the end point after a command was executed was significantly better for both the kinesthetic + visual feedback and narrative methods compared to the visual-only method. Together, these results suggest that the use of both kinesthetic + visual feedback improves an individual’s ability to interpret program commands, rather than decreases it.",programing | robotics | scratch | visually impaired users,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,NSF,1742242,National Science Foundation

Indeed, the tremendous progress achieved by machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence over the last decade has been largely achieved via the utilization of static data sets, from the paradigmatic MNIST to the bespoke corpora of text and image data used to train large models such as GPT3, DALL·E and others. However, it is now recognized that continuous, minute improvements to state-of-the-art do not necessarily translate to advances in real-world applications. We argue that a promising pathway for the development of ML methods is via the route of domain-specific deployable algorithms in areas such as electron and scanning probe microscopy and chemical imaging. This will benefit both fundamental physical studies and serve as a test bed for more complex autonomous systems such as robotics and manufacturing. Favorable environment characteristics of scanning and electron microscopy include low risk, extensive availability of domain-specific priors and rewards, relatively small effects of exogenous variables, and often the presence of both upstream first principles as well as downstream learnable physical models for both statics and dynamics. Recent developments in programmable interfaces, edge computing, and access to application programming interfaces (APIs) facilitating microscope control, all render the deployment of ML codes on operational microscopes straightforward.

The robot then zooms to the fine-resolution inference part to perform the concrete action corresponding to the action language. Fine-resolution inference is constructed as a Markov decision process, which takes action language and environmental sensing as observations and outputs the action. The results of action execution in environments provide feedback for subsequent coarse-resolution reasoning. Such coarse-to-fine inference allows the robot to decompose and achieve long-horizon tasks interactively.

A key question of cognition-enabled and AI-driven robotics is how to organize and manage such data and knowledge efficiently in a cognitive robot control architecture. We argue, that memory is a central active component of such architectures that mediates between semantic and sensorimotor representations, orchestrates the flow of data streams and events between different processes and provides the components of a cognitive architecture with data-driven services for learning semantics from sensorimotor data, the parametrization of symbolic plans for execution and prediction of action effects. Based on related work, and the experience gained in developing our ARMAR humanoid robot systems, we identified conceptual and technical requirements of a memory system as central component of cognitive robot control architecture that facilitate the realization of high-level cognitive abilities such as explaining, reasoning, prospection, simulation and augmentation. Conceptually, a memory should be active, support multi-modal data representations, associate knowledge, be introspective, and have an inherently episodic structure. Technically, the memory should support a distributed design, be access-efficient and capable of long-term data storage. We introduce the memory system for our cognitive robot control architecture and its implementation in the robot software framework ArmarX.

Here, the linear regression (LR)-based classical approach is merged with the gravitational search algorithm (GSA), called RGSA, and Chaos is added to achieve an optimum path. To improve upon the local traps, Chaos is introduced into the basic structure of the RGSA model to attain a global solution without effecting the higher convergence rate of the RGSA model. The Chaos further adds ergodicity to the dynamical system, gaining an optimal path length in the shortest time possible. The use of the proposed hybridization technique is found to be effective as compared to its counterparts. Various chaotic maps like the logistic map, Gauss map, piecewise linear chaotic map, and sinusoidal maps are used, and the results are compared. Also, the smoothness of the path is ensured during trajectory planning. The analysis is done in real-time lab conditions and simulation environments using single and multiple humanoids (Nao robots) with static and dynamic obstacles within the search space. The simulation for the path planning is done using the Webot software, while the choregraphe software is used for experimental path planning. The simulation and experimental work presented in the current paper shows good agreement and are within 6% acceptable limits. The proposed controller is then compared with a vision-based approach and another parallel sensor-based approach for optimum operational cost and smoother trajectory. The current work is a novel approach in which the humanoid's interaction with the mobile robot is also analyzed. The proposed approach successfully avoided the dynamic obstacle in the form of the KHEPERA-II mobile robot. This concept can find potential applications in soccer scenarios employing mobile robots as opponent players to the Nao robots. Further, because of the lower operational cost, the proposed methodology can also be applied to other areas, such as multitasking, cooperative scheduling, power distribution systems, etc.",C-RGSA | Humanoid robot | Hybrid techniques | Nao | Path planning | Webot,3,0,,,,undefined,

Participants moved their hands along one of three body-based axes (longitudinal, transverse, and frontal) when referring to chronological sequences. These findings were broadly in keeping with those found in previous work on University computing students’ gestures.

Scratch and LEGO robots are two popular block-based programming tools. However, the objects they manipulate are completely different. Scratch manipulates graphical virtual sprites, whereas LEGO robots manipulate physical robots. Different manipulating objects may bring students varied learning experiences. Objectives: This study compared undergraduate students' learning engagement and flow experience when programming on Scratch and LEGO robots. Methods: The study was conducted in a programming course which involved 28 Chinese undergraduates. At the end of the 14-week course, all students were requested to complete the questionnaire twice, one for their perceptions of Scratch and the other for those of LEGO robotics. Three semi-structured focus-group interviews were also conducted for students' perceptions of the course. Results and Conclusions: The results showed that LEGO robots scored significantly higher on behavioural and emotional engagement, while cognitive engagement was not significantly different. As for the flow experience, Scratch provided students with a greater sense of control, while LEGO robots allowed students to experience temporal distortion.

In this paper, we present the development of a new method to automate silicone sealing with robotic manipulators. To this end, we propose a novel neural path planning framework that leverages fractional-order differentiation for robust seam detection with vision and a Riemannian motion policy for effectively learning the manipulation of a sealing gun. Optimal control commands can be computed analytically by designing a deep neural network that predicts the acceleration and associated Riemannian metric of the sealing gun from feedback signals. The performance of our new methodology is experimentally validated with a robotic platform conducting multiple silicone sealing tasks in unstructured situations.

With the use of a target detection algorithm, the position of the human hand in the color image of the physical environment can be identified and its pixel coordinates can be calculated. Meanwhile, the synthetic images of the virtual robot environment are combined with those of the physical robot scene to determine whether the human hand is in contact with the robot. Besides, a human motion intention recognition model based on deep learning is designed to recognize human motion intention with the input of sEMG signals.

Thus, this article presents the learning by Demonstration (LbD) approach for planning the spatial point-to-point motions of a multi-section continuum robot. Via teleoperation, the human demonstrations are captured by moving the flexible interface with similar kinematics of the active robot in front of the Motion Capture System (MCS). Meanwhile, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) scheme is proposed based on the robot’s kinematic model to follow the reference trajectories while respecting the constraints imposed by the cable lengths and control actions. The simulation results prove the efficiency of the LbD approach in reproducing and generalizing the spatial motions of the robot’s tip and avoiding obstacles and external disturbances. On the other hand, the numerical simulations show the performance of NMPC scheme in terms of trajectory tracking and avoiding static and dynamic obstacles. Additionally, its robustness is analyzed by comparing it to the Pseudo-Inverse Jacobian Kinematic Control (PIJKC) while considering the constraints of cable lengths.

To extend the ability of sampling-based algorithms, we integrate a vision-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) non-prehensile procedure, pusher. The pushing actions generated by pusher can eliminate interlocked situations and make the grasping problem solvable. Also, the sampling-based algorithm evaluates the pushing actions by providing rewards in the training process, thus the pusher can learn to avoid situations leading to irreversible failures. The proposed hybrid planning method is validated on a cluttered bin-picking problem and implemented in both simulation and real world.

Prediction and monitoring of power quality (PQ) along with efficient utilization of Renewable Energy (RE) is unavoidable to optimize the system performance without abnormalities. Alterations and irregularities in PQ must remain within the prescribed norm ranges and characteristics to allow fault-tolerant operation of the detached system in various modes of attached equipment. The PQ data for all possible combinations of grid-attached household appliances and different inside/outside conditions cannot be measured completely or described exactly by physical equations. PQ predictions on a daily basis using Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are needed because atmospheric fluctuations and anomalies in local weather with uncertainties in system states primarily influence the induced power and operation of real off-grids. A novel soft-computing method using Differential Learning, which allows modelling of complex dynamics of weather-dependent systems, is presented and compared with the recent standard deep and probabilistic machine learning. The AI models were evolved using weather data and the binary status of attached equipment in the test predetermined daily training periods. Daily statistical models process 24-h forecast data and definition load series of trained input variables to calculate the target PQ parameters at the same times. Optimal utilization, efficiency, and failure-free operation of smart grids can be planned according to the suggested operable power consumption scenarios based on their PQ verification on a day-horizon. Executable load sequences can be automatically combined and scheduled in the system to be adapted to user needs, considering the RE production potential, charge state, and optimal PQ characteristics over the next 24 h.

To that end, MutRoSe allows an MRS mission designer to define all relevant aspects of a mission and its environment in a high-level specification language that accounts for the variability of real-world scenarios, the dependencies between task instances, and the reusability of task libraries. Additionally, MutRoSe automates the decomposition of MRS missions defined in this language into task instances, which can then be allocated to specific robots for execution—with all task dependencies appropriately taken into account. We illustrate the application of MutRoSe and show its effectiveness for four missions taken from a recently published repository of MRS applications.",Hierarchical planning | Mission decomposition | Mission specification | Modeling | Multi-robot systems,0,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,UKRI,EP/V026747/1,UK Research and Innovation

One of the effective solutions is combining DMP and model predictive control (MPC). The imitation process was transformed into a receding horizon planning procedure, letting the robot to learn more from nearer demonstrations. It is solved as an optimization problem with obstacles modeled as constraints.

Firstly, an improved mayfly optimization algorithm based on Q-learning (IMOA-QL) is proposed to solve robot global path planning problem. Q-learning is taken as the core of the improved mayfly optimization algorithm. For the basic MOA, the inertia weight and positive attraction coefficients are set to fixed values, which are not reasonable and will make the global search ability unbalanced, fall into local optimization easily, and also limit the iteration speed. In this paper, the parameters are adaptively adjusted based on Q-learning, and the appropriate parameters are selected according to the fitness of each mayfly. Meanwhile, the memory mechanism is introduced to speed up the convergence speed and implement the global path planning. Then, the global path nodes are extracted as the sub-target points, and the improved dynamic window approach is used to carry out the local path planning, which effectively improves the dynamic real-time avoidance ability. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed IMOA-QL algorithm in this paper, 20 random simulation experiments are carried out in the 100 × 100 static map environment and compared with the basic mayfly optimization algorithm (MOA) and the mayfly optimization algorithm based on linear adaptive inertia weight (MOA-LAIW). The results show that the average path length of the proposed IMOA-QL algorithm is reduced by 4.48% and 2.17% compared with MOA and MOA-LAIW in simple environment, and the average path length of the proposed IMOA-QL algorithm is reduced by 6.58% and 3.24% compared with MOA and MOA-LAIW in complex environment. In 20 experiments, the average variance of the proposed IMOA-QL algorithm in this paper is reduced by 74.15% and 57.67% compared with MOA and MOA-LAIW in simple environment, and the average variance of the proposed IMOA-QL algorithm is reduced by 51.22% and 38.67% in complex environment compared with MOA and MOA-LAIW. The simulation results show that the proposed IMOA-QL algorithm has significantly improved the accuracy and speed of solution. Moreover, dynamic obstacles are added in the static environment to carry out the simulation test of the fusion dynamic path planning algorithm.

This analytic expression simplifies the differential equations and enables us to solve for the optimal value function using value iteration for continuous actions and states as well as the adversarial case. Notably, the resulting algorithms do not require discretization of states or actions. We apply the resulting algorithms to the Furuta pendulum and cartpole. We show that both algorithms obtain the optimal policy. The robustness Sim2Real experiments on the physical systems show that the policies successfully achieve the task in the real-world. When changing the masses of the pendulum, we observe that robust value iteration is more robust compared to deep reinforcement learning algorithm and the non-robust version of the algorithm.

However, most of the researches conducted so far focused on centralized algorithms or fully observable environments. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation algorithm for partially observable worlds that extends Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP) to a multi-agent world using a self-absorbed view. This extension is performed in two different ways: Using a POMCP tree with single actions but encoding the other agents’ actions implicitly in the tree edges, which we call SPOMCP. The second view, called GPOMCP, is to apply a POMCP tree with action profiles besides doing a coordinate-wise optimization to find the best single action. Experimental results show that SPOMCP and GPOMCP do fairly well compared to other algorithms. SPOMCP consumes more time than GPOMCP for each iteration since it needs to take time to infer other robots’ actions. GPOMCP does not do such an inference step because its search tree is built by action profiles. Comparison with a centralized POMCP (CPOMCP) indicates that while both SPOMCP and GPOMCP are fully decentralized, they can reach the performance of CPOMCP. However, SPOMCP and GPOMCP consume much less time than CPOMCP.",Monte-Carlo planning | Multi-robot systems | Partially observable world | Task allocation | Teamwork,1,0,,,IUT,undefined,Isfahan University of Technology

However, the main drawback is that the approach has to construct the fingerprint map manually during the off-line stage, which is tedious and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel data collection strategy for path planning based on reinforcement learning, namely Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C). Given the limited exploration step length, it needs to maximize the informative CSI data for reducing manual cost. We collect a small amount of real data in advance to predict the rewards of all sampling points by multivariate Gaussian process and mutual information. Then the optimization problem is transformed into a sequential decision process, which can exploit the informative path by A3C.

There are two main techniques for programming the robots such as online and offline programming. However, the time spent on programming a new trajectory is a major challenge in deploying welding robots, which makes these approaches less efficient. This article presents a two-stage method employing multisensor interaction for the path planning of a welding robot. The proposed scheme enhances weld seam trajectory development and creates a highly adjustable intelligent guidance programming system for welding robots. A global stage approach utilizing the RGB-D camera, which combines fast 2-D object recognition and 3-D reconstruction models, is proposed to quickly identify the coarse trajectory. The processes of fast 2-D object recognition and 3-D reconstruction are carried out using a deep neural network model and stereo vision sensor module. This technique can be a better replacement for offline programming or hand gesture controls also known as the teaching trajectory, particularly for the welding robot application. The local positioning stage is then applied using the laser vision module to obtain more precise information of the local environment, guided by the coarse trajectory that was realized in the prior stage (global stage). The efficacy of the proposed system is analyzed by conducting numerous tests using an experimental setup.

Specifically, there have been no studies examining the association between students’ learning outcomes and their absorption and need for cognition on different platforms, such as Scratch and LEGO® WeDo. This study aims to provide empirical evidence by comparing the impact of two different platforms commonly used in programming courses to teach undergraduate students how to design, develop, and program IoT projects using educational robots. A quasi-experimental study was carried out to examine whether there were any significant variations in students’ CT skills and programming development, as well as to evaluate their learning outcomes with regard to their need for cognition and absorption when they applied their coding expertise to real-world IoT projects. As a point of reference (control condition), twenty students (n = 20) utilized LEGO® WeDo robotics kits and Scratch for coding tasks, which is the most familiar instructional approach. In the intervention approach (experimental condition), thirty-seven students (n = 37) used LEGO® WeDo robotics kits and their software to learn how to code their educational robots. Participants from the latter group learned how to design and demonstrate the program and showed superior CT skills and programming skills development than their counterparts in the control group who used Scratch.

In this paper, we solve the inefficient convergence problem at the two levels of the action selection strategy and reward functions. First, this paper designs a dynamic action selection strategy that has a high probability of providing positive samples in the pre-training period by using a variable guide item and effectively reduces invalid exploration. Second, this study proposes a combinatorial reward function that combines the artificial potential field method with a time-energy function, thereby greatly improving the efficiency and stability of DRL-based methods for manipulators trajectory planning in dynamic working environments. Extensive experiments are conducted using the CoppeliaSim simulation model with a freely moving obstacle and the 6-DOF manipulator. The results show that the proposed dynamic action selection strategy and combinatorial reward function can improve the convergence rate on the DDPG, TD3, and SAC DRL algorithms by up to 3-5 times.

Especially for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), whose application has increased recently, path planning in a three-dimensional (3D) environment is a common problem. This study performs three experimental applications to discover the most suitable path for UAV in 3D environments with large and many obstacles. Inspired by Rapidly Random-Exploring Tree Star (RRT*), the first implementation develops the Goal Distance-based RRT* (GDRRT*) approach, which performs intelligent sampling taking into account the goal distance. In the second implementation, the path discovered by GDRRT* is shortened using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) (PSO-GDRRT*).

To generate groundtruth paths for training the learning-based network, PSO-GDRRT* finds the shortest paths relatively quickly.

Such tasks are often modeled as submodular maximization coordination problems.

However, the deep-learning compilers proposed so far generate codes that sequentially execute DNN operators on a single processing unit or parallel codes for graphic processing units (GPUs).

PartitionTuner can generate an operator-scheduling plan that uses all available PUs simultaneously to minimize overall DNN inference time.

However, during plan execution, the controller may deviate from the collision-free path found by the planner due to discrepancies between planning and control, causing inaccurate estimation of path costs and potentially collisions with obstacles. While this can be mitigated by incorporating the vehicle controller into planning, these approaches are generally bottlenecked by the high computation cost of simulating the vehicle dynamics and controller. This letter presents the Parallel Closed-Loop RRT∗ motion planner that uses a fast neural network controller as a substitute for a computationally-demanding controller during planning. Using a neural network controller and parallelizing the planning process makes closed-loop planning tractable for vehicles with nonlinear dynamics and significantly reduces planning time. Experiments on a simulated underwater vehicle with a model predictive controller demonstrate that our approach yields feasible plans that are more likely to be successfully executed without collisions compared to planners that do not consider the controller.",Integrated planning and control | integrated planning and learning | motion and path planning,0,0,,,ONR,N0014-21-1-2052,Office of Naval Research

The human is, indeed, placed in the center of the production environment, having a supervision/leading role instead of carrying out heavy/repetitive tasks. To enhance such an industrial paradigm change, industrial operators have to be provided with the tools they need to naturally and easily transfer their knowledge to robotic systems. Such expertise, in fact, is difficult to be coded, especially for non-expert programmers. In addition, due to the reduced specialized manpower, the capability to transfer such knowledge into robotic systems is becoming increasingly critical and demanding. In response to this need, this contribution aims to propose and validate a human-centric approach to transfer the human's knowledge of a task into the robot controller making use of qualitative feedback only (to this end, preference-based optimization is employed). In addition, the modeled human's knowledge is exploited by an optimization algorithm (i.e., nonlinear programming) to maximize the task performance while managing the task constraints. The proposed approach has been implemented and validated for a robotic sealant material deposition task. On the basis of the qualitative feedback provided by the operator, the knowledge related to the deposition task has been transferred to the robotic system and optimized to deal with the hardware and task constraints.

The primary IGSA suffers from the disadvantage of a lower convergence rate and the risk of getting trapped in optimal local conditions. The drawbacks are eliminated by employing a hybrid IGSA-DV path planning approach, which improves the memory and velocity updating scheme. The algorithm is designed to minimize the overall path length of the humanoid, from source to goal, in the minimal time possible. The humanoids, during their locomotion, coordinate with each other to avoid collisions in their journey. The robots make decisions based on the position of the various obstacles within the search space. So, path smoothness is also considered to ensure stability during the locomotion. The work is further focussed on optimizing the energy efficiency of the different joints of the humanoid while walking on even and uneven surfaces. The path planning is performed in real-world and simulation environments, and the results are then compared with the different existing, individual, and hybrid techniques. The comparison of the above approach revealed that the IGSA-DV algorithm showed an optimal outcome in terms of path length and time taken. Moreover, the percentage deviation in the path length and time in both the simulation and experimental environment was within 6%.

Planning explicitly over a long time horizon, however, incurs prohibitive computational cost and is impractical under real-time constraints. To achieve real-time performance for large-scale planning, this work introduces a new algorithm Learning from Tree Search for Driving (LeTS-Drive), which integrates planning and learning in a closed loop, and applies it to autonomous driving in crowded urban traffic in simulation. Specifically, LeTS-Drive learns a policy and its value function from data provided by an online planner, which searches a sparsely sampled belief tree; the online planner in turn uses the learned policy and value functions as heuristics to scale up its run-time performance for real-time robot control. These two steps are repeated to form a closed loop so that the planner and the learner inform each other and improve in synchrony. The algorithm learns on its own in a self-supervised manner, without human effort on explicit data labeling. Experimental results demonstrate that LeTS-Drive outperforms either planning or learning alone, as well as open-loop integration of planning and learning.",Autonomous driving | planning under uncertainty | robot learning,0,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

On the other hand, the great flexibility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has made them effective gadgets to enhance the coverage of wireless communication networks. Combining these two emerging technologies, the RIS-outfitted UAV (RISoUAV) is a promising solution for providing line-of-sight (LoS) wireless links for mobile targets (MTs) in obstructed high-dense urban areas. In this light, high-speed real-Time communication is essential for some vital municipal services like ambulances, fire engines, security guards, police, etc. This important goal is achievable thanks to the RISoUAV-Assisted 5G/quasi-optic wireless communication. This paper develops a framework for optimal navigation of a team of RISoUAVs for maintaining LoS links with a team of ground vehicles in a dense urban area. The trajectories of the RISoUAVs are optimized considering the energy efficiency, communication channel gains, and constraints associated with RISoUAVs motion and LoS service. A consensus-based coordinating approach is adopted to coordinate the RISoUAVs navigation to cover all MTs under a good quality of service. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the method. Note to Practitioners-In this paper, we consider a scenario where vehicles need to have high-speed, uninterrupted data links in obstructed, highly dense urban environments. Due to spectrum crunch, the data links are increasingly likely to rely on a high-frequency spectrum, including mmWave with quasi-optic nature, visible light communications, or even laser. However, the obstructed LoS and propagation are critical issues with the 5G and beyond as they rely on the availability of an unobstructed path (e.g., the LoS or a quality reflective path). On the other hand, the RIS performs as a passive reflective element that provides an indirect LoS link, a one-bounce channel, to improve the performance and efficiency of mmWave, and beyond, wireless communication networks. UAVs equipped with RISs are suggested in this paper to be adopted as aerial transponders to reflect signals and facilitate communication in high-density environments. Therefore, the problem of UAV navigation and 3D trajectory planning should be addressed regarding the application, particularly, for providing LoS service for mobile vehicles with arbitrary directions. Autonomous navigation of RISoUAVs for LoS wireless communication is a natural multi-dimensional extension of autonomous navigation with obstacle avoidance where regions in which LoS communication is lost are viewed as obstacles to avoid. However, the environment and valid LoS links can change dynamically due to moving vehicles in the obstructed environment. This makes the navigation design an NP-hard problem that is tackled in this paper by developing an effective navigation program.",Autonomous navigation | optimal trajectory | path planning | reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) | unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) | wireless communication,0,0,,,,undefined,

In terms of the aforementioned problems, an adaptive dynamic programming (ADP)-based optimal learning sliding mode controller is proposed in this paper. Specifically, under the frame of adaptive dynamic programming, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation can be addressed. Then, based on the gradient attenuation algorithm, critic neural networks (NNs) are trained depending on the designed updating law and the approximate optimal learning controller can be obtained. Lyapunov techniques and Lasalle's invariance principle are used to guarantee asymptotic stability of the dual ship-mounted cranes system. Finally, a series of simulation results are depicted to show the effectiveness of the proposed optimal learning sliding mode controller. Note to Practitioners-In this paper, the control problem of a 5 DOF dual ship-mounted cranes system with unmatched wave disturbance is studied. Due to the complex nonlinear characteristics of the dual ship-mounted cranes and the need to consider the cooperative lifting and wave disturbances, the operation of the dual ship-mounted cranes are very challenging. Moreover, it brings more difficulties to the design of this kind of controller due to its nonlinear underactuated property. Existing control methods for dual ship-mounted cranes are based on linearized or oversimplified crane models, or require accurate model. To solve these kinds of problems, this paper proposes a new control approach for dual ship-mounted cranes suffering from unmatched wave disturbances to achieve satisfactory performance. The stability analysis of the closed-loop systems equilibrium point is implemented by Lyapunov techniques, implying that the accurate positioning and fast payload swings suppression against unmatched wave disturbances are achieved concurrently. In the future studies, we will apply the proposed control method to industrial dual ship-mounted cranes systems to improve their working safety and efficiency.",adaptive dynamic programming | critic neural network | Dual ship-mounted cranes system | nonlinear system | optimal learning sliding mode control,4,0,,,,undefined,

However, most current sampling-based path planning algorithms are easy to fall into the trap space in complex and dynamic environments. In this article, a fast path planning algorithm based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is proposed to allow robotic systems to efficiently extract feature nodes and generate collision-free paths considering the pedestrian density and the environmental structure. First, the preliminary feature nodes are obtained by training GMM, in which the covariance matrix of each feature node contains the environmental structure information. Second, an online feature learning method is presented to extract features during the movement of the robot by the dual-channel scale filter and the secondary distance fusion. Once the obstacle-free grid points can be connected to the feature nodes without any collision, a heuristic path is generated directly to guide the robot to avoid the crowds according to the proposed pedestrian matrix. For the same environment, the learned information can be reused as prior knowledge in the next path planning to further improve the efficiency of path replanning. A series of experimental studies demonstrate that our proposed method can remarkably reduce the time taken to reach a goal and enhance the success rate of navigation in trapped and narrow environments.",Gaussian mixture model (GMM) | mobile robots | online feature learning | sampling-based path planning,3,0,,,,undefined,

In the first stage, the robot estimates potential approaching poses of a human or a human group, which the robot can safely and socially approach, using the dynamic social zone model. In the second stage, the proposed framework selects a socially optimal approaching pose, then estimate a socially optimal trajectory of the robot using the proposed goal-oriented timed elastic band (GTEB) model. The developed GTEB model takes into account the current robot's states, robot dynamics, dynamic social zone, regular obstacles and potential approaching poses to generate the socially optimal robot trajectory from the robot's current pose to the selected optimal approaching pose. The motion control command extracted from the socially optimal trajectory is then utilized to drive the mobile robot to approach the individual humans or human groups, while safely and socially avoiding regular obstacles, human and human groups during the navigation process. The proposed approaching human framework is verified in the both simulation and real robots. The results illustrate that, the mobile robot equipped with our developed GTEB model is able to safely and socially approach and avoid individual humans and human groups, while guaranteeing the comfortable safety for the humans and socially acceptable behaviors for the robot. Note to Practitioners - Although our proposed GTEB model is capable of estimating a socially optimal approaching pose and social robot trajectory, driving the robot to approach a human and a human group, and providing the safety and comfort for humans and socially acceptable behaviors of the robot, there exists a few drawbacks if we wish to apply the proposed approaching human framework in dynamic social environments. First, the optimizer for the GTEB model should be improved in terms of computational time and accuracy to avoid generating unpredictable robot trajectories, especially in dynamic social environments. Second, the socio-spatio-temporal characteristics of the humans including human position, motion and orientation, and human group and human-object interactions play an important role in the proposed GTEB model. However, the existing techniques are only suitable in quasi-dynamic social environments. Hence, highly accurate, robust and real-time algorithms for human detection and tracking, and social interaction detection are necessary. Third, social interactive intentions such as human-robot, human-human and human-object interactive intentions should be predicted and incorporated into the proposed framework to improve the performance of the developed framework in the dynamic social environments. Last but not least, human and human group identification algorithms should be proposed to enable the robot to identify the humans, whose the mobile robot is requested to approach. In the future, the social interactive intentions, the human's future states and its trajectories and will be predicted using deep learning algorithms and incorporated into the approaching human framework to improve the performance of the proposed framework.",human approaching methods | Mobile service robots | social robots | socially aware robot navigation | timed elastic band,0,0,,,,undefined,

The geometric information is extracted from the point cloud of obstacles. By analyzing the properties of the point cloud, we propose a VAE feature extraction net that incorporates the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework with unique architectures designed for point clouds. Furthermore, we design a multi-modal sampling net to model the probability distribution of the states based on training trajectories taken from different environments. Based on PGSN, we propose a sampling-based motion planning algorithm called the point-guided rapidly-exploring random tree (PG-RRT). Three experiments are conducted to verify the proposed PGSN: Exp I shows the proposed VAE feature extraction net can successfully extract geometric features from the inputted point cloud; Exp II verifies the multi-modal sampling net successfully chooses corresponding mode with respect to extracted features; Exp III demonstrates the efficacy of our PG-RRT algorithm by showing PG-RRT outperforms other algorithms. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis and insights towards understanding our model.

To improve the success rate and efficiency of SBMP, this paper proposes a novel deep neural network called points-guided sampling net (PGSN). PGSN is designed to exploit: (1) environmental point clouds and (2) training trajectories from multiple environments with different obstacles. In the first step, the point clouds include important geometric information. To utilize this information, we adopt a variational autoencoder approach which combines an encoder and a decoder together to extract geometric features more accurately from point clouds. In the second step, trajectories from multiple environments have a multi-modal property which can be represented by a truncated multivariate Gaussian mixture model. We propose a multi-modal sampling net to learn optimal parameters of this model from the training trajectories, and to select corresponding mode based on the extracted features. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is feasible and can achieve higher success rate than the state-of-the-art methods.

However, this topological map could also have bottlenecks which leads to deadlocks and low transportation efficiency when used for an MRS.

However, human internal models are not always perfect: for example, it is easy to underestimate a robot's inertia. Nevertheless, these models change and improve over time as humans gather more experience. Interestingly, robot actions infuence what this experience is, and therefore infuence how people's internal models change. In this work we take a step towards enabling robots to understand the infuence they have, leverage it to better assist people, and help human models more quickly align with reality. Our key idea is to model the human's learning as a nonlinear dynamical system which evolves the human's internal model given new observations. We formulate a novel optimization problem to infer the human's learning dynamics from demonstrations that naturally exhibit human learning. We then formalize how robots can infuence human learning by embedding the human's learning dynamics model into the robot planning problem. Although our formulations provide concrete problem statements, they are intractable to solve in full generality. We contribute an approximation that sacrifces the complexity of the human internal models we can represent, but enables robots to learn the nonlinear dynamics of these internal models. We evaluate our inference and planning methods in a suite of simulated environments and an in-person user study, where a 7DOF robotic arm teaches participants to be better teleoperators.

Our curriculum is functional-first, using abstraction, functional decomposition, immutable data, and powerful higher-order functions such as map, keep, and combine. Based on a decade of experience teaching thousands of first-time programmers, we believe starting with functions teaches students the habit of solving problems functionally when possible, helping to avoid bugs in later programming experiences. BJC Sparks uses the Snap! blocks-based programming environment, which brings the expressive power of a general-purpose programming language without requiring mastery of the syntax of a text-based language. We take advantage of new Snap! features to develop microworlds: customized projects that simplify the blocks palette to further lower cognitive load. We designed projects that use Snap!'s multimedia features to explore data science, encryption, and computational media. We end with physical computing using the BBC micro:bit that students program using MicroBlocks. In terms of findings, we confirmed that it indeed was possible to capture the interest of middle school students with functional programming activities, especially through the use of microworlds. We were surprised at the strong student and teacher interest in our micro:bit lessons, which many wanted as a stand-alone unit. Finally, it became quite clear that multimedia and data science projects offer promising avenues for teaching functional programming through fun, engaging, and personally relevant activities.",blocks-based programming | data science | functional programming | media computation | middle school | snap!,0,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,NSF,1138596,National Science Foundation

During human-robot interaction(HRI), the potential risk of any injury to workers caused by industrial robots is very critical and should be well-addressed to ensure manufacturing safety. However, in the dynamic and uncertain manufacturing environment, the current HRI safety is still based on the robot's perception of the environment to achieve collision avoidance, lacking adaptable decision-makings under mutual cognition. Therefore, to enhance the cognition of human operators in the working environment and improve the robot's collision avoidance and adaptive motion planning capabilities, this work designs and further implements a mutual cognitive HRI safety system based on augmented reality (AR) in a wearable manner. In the proposed system, the wearable AR device serves as the bridging interface to realize the virtual-real registration of the robot, the virtual-physical mapping of the working environment of the HRI process, and to collect the information of human, robot, and working space. In addition to these, a hierarchical HRI safety strategy is introduced for real-time mutual cognitive assistance to both humans and robots, namely: 1) robot motion speed control and safety area visualization based on human-robot distance, 2) virtual-physical mapping for robot motion preview and collision detection, and 3) deep reinforcement learning-driven motion planning for collision avoidance strategies generation. Lastly, a prototype system is further developed to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategies.

Motivated by these rigorous demands, we propose a reachability-aware multi-fingered grasp planning framework that can synthesize feasible high-DOF grasps for novel objects in unrestricted workspace. The framework includes an end-to-end voxel-based Grasp Prediction Network (GPN) for generating stable multi-fingered grasp configurations and a learned Grasping Reachability Evaluator (GRE) to estimate kinematic reachability. The GPN takes as input a voxel representation of the scene and directly outputs the predicted collision-free multi-fingered grasps and the associated grasping stability. The GRE then evaluates the grasping reachability of each generated grasp configuration. Based on the predicted grasping reachability and stability, the most feasible grasp is ultimately executed by the robot. In contrast to previous methods that plan successful grasps within restricted workspace solely based on grasping stability, our approach further incorporates a concept of reachability into the online multi-fingered grasp planning via neural networks. The real-world experiments show that our approach outperforms several comparable methods and achieves an average completion rate of 82.2% for unseen cluttered objects in unrestricted scenarios.

We also present a newly created data set for LocateUAV, which comprises challenging scenarios for context analysis. Moreover, we also compress an existing lightweight model up to 45 MB for efficient processing over UAV, which is 19.5% when compared with the size of the original model.

Many attempts for solutions in the literature are based on machine learning, generally relying on deep neural network architectures. In typical imitation approaches, the deep network learns from a human expert. In our case the network is trained on state/action pairs obtained through a Belief Space Planning algorithm, a stochastic method that requires only a rough tuning, particularly suited to unstructured and dynamic environments. Our approach allows to obtain a lightweight manipulation system that demonstrated its efficiency, robustness and good performance in real-world tests, and that is reproducible in experiments and results, despite its inaccuracy and non-repeatable kinematics. The proposed system performs well on a simple reaching task, requiring limited training on our quite challenging platform. The main contribution of the proposed work lies in the definition and real-world testing of an efficient controller, based on the integration of Belief Space Planning with the imitation learning paradigm, that enables even inaccurate, very low-cost robotic manipulators to be actually controlled and employed in the field.",Belief space planning | Imitation learning | Inaccurate lightweight manipulator | Soft robotics,0,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,

A path is generated by connecting the initial and goal configurations through graph exploration, whereby the path is often desired to be optimal or suboptimal. The computational performance of the optimal path generation depends on the avoidance of unnecessary explorations. Accordingly, heuristic functions have been widely adopted to guide the exploration efficiently by providing estimated costs to the goal configurations. The exploration is efficient when the heuristic functions estimate the optimal cost closely, which remains challenging because it requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment. However, this challenge presents the scope to improve the computational efficiency over the existing methods. Herein, we propose reinforcement learning heuristic A∗ (RLHA*), which adopts an artificial neural network as a learning heuristic function to closely estimate the optimal cost, while achieving a bounded suboptimal path. Instead of being trained by precomputed paths, the learning heuristic function keeps improving by using self-generated paths.

Though we began with a textual programming environment, as we analysed teaching and learning practices in junior high schools, we developed a visual block programming environment for teaching programming, initially because students were not very familiar with the keyboard. The block programming environment, however, had unexpected effects of motivating students, of both genders, whose power seemed to have come from the students' collaborative interactions while working on their programs. We conducted a series of surveys and tested which socio-emotional factors best contributed to learning programming in the classroom environment, as assessed by end-of-class project and exam scores.

For mobile robots performing unmanned delivery tasks, autonomous robot navigation based on complex environments is particularly important. In this paper, an improved Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO)-based algorithm is proposed to realize the autonomous path planning of mobile robots in complex scenarios. First, the strategy for generating the initial wolf pack of the GWO algorithm is modified by introducing a two-dimensional Tent–Sine coupled chaotic mapping in this paper. This guarantees that the GWO algorithm generates the initial population diversity while improving the randomness between the two-dimensional state variables of the path nodes. Second, by introducing the opposition-based learning method based on the elite strategy, the adaptive nonlinear inertia weight strategy and random wandering law of the Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA), this paper improves the defects of slow convergence speed, low accuracy, and imbalance between global exploration and local mining functions of the GWO algorithm in dealing with high-dimensional complex problems. In this paper, the improved algorithm is named as an EWB-GWO algorithm, where EWB is the abbreviation of three strategies. Finally, this paper enhances the rationalization of the initial population generation of the EWB-GWO algorithm based on the visual-field line detection technique of Bresenham’s line algorithm, reduces the number of iterations of the EWB-GWO algorithm, and decreases the time complexity of the algorithm in dealing with the path planning problem. The simulation results show that the EWB-GWO algorithm is very competitive among metaheuristics of the same type. It also achieves optimal path length measures and smoothness metrics in the path planning experiments.",adaptive nonlinear inertia weights | BOA algorithm | GWO algorithm | mobile robot | opposition-based learning | path planning | two-dimensional chaotic mapping,2,1,repositoryvor,Green,,2022CDPFAT-01,

Exploration efficiency and prediction accuracy largely depend on appropriate waypoint decision. In this paper, an informative path planning approach is proposed based on the reinforcement learning paradigm for static environment exploration. In contrast to model based algorithms, no assumption is presumed for the environmental features. The computational cost is reduced and the online planning capability is enhanced by evaluating the values of actions through robot’s interaction with the environment. To improve the prediction accuracy, an action selection algorithm based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) is utilized to balance exploration and utilization. Exploration in unknown areas is encouraged, which also potentially avoid stucking into local extrema. Numerical simulations have been performed on environments that are modeled with Gaussian distribution and Ackley function respectively. Results show that the characteristics of the entire environment field can be effectively captured using the proposed path planning approach.",informative path planning | mobile robot | reinforcement learning | unknown environment exploration | upper confidence bound,0,0,,,,undefined,

One of the promising approaches to solve it is decomposing the problem into the smaller sub-problems and combining the local solutions into the global one. The crux of any planning method for non-holonomic robots is the generation of motion primitives that generates solutions to local planning sub-problems. In this work we introduce a novel learnable steering function (policy), which takes into account kinodynamic constraints of the robot and both static and dynamic obstacles. This policy is efficiently trained via the policy optimization. Empirically, we show that our steering function generalizes well to unseen problems. We then plug in the trained policy into the sampling-based and lattice-based planners, and evaluate the resultant POLAMP algorithm (Policy Optimization that Learns Adaptive Motion Primitives) in a range of challenging setups that involve a car-like robot operating in the obstacle-rich parking-lot environments. We show that POLAMP is able to plan collision-free kinodynamic trajectories with success rates higher than 92%, when 50 simultaneously moving obstacles populate the environment showing better performance than the state-of-the-art competitors.",Motion and path planning | reinforcement learning | task and motion planning,0,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

This task becomes even more difficult when the robot lacks an accurate model of the object to be grasped. Tactile sensing offers a promising approach to account for uncertainties in object shape. However, current robotic hands tend to lack full tactile coverage. As such, a problem arises of how to plan and execute grasps for multi-fingered hands such that contact is made with the area covered by the tactile sensors. To address this issue, we propose an approach to grasp planning that explicitly reasons about where the fingertips should contact the estimated object surface while maximizing the probability of grasp success. Key to our method's success is the use of visual surface estimation for initial planning to encode the contact constraint. The robot then executes this plan using a tactile-feedback controller that enables the robot to adapt to online estimates of the object's surface to correct for errors in the initial plan. Importantly, the robot never explicitly integrates object pose or surface estimates between visual and tactile sensing, instead it uses the two modalities in complementary ways. Vision guides the robots motion prior to contact; touch updates the plan when contact occurs differently than predicted from vision. We show that our method successfully synthesises and executes precision grasps for previously unseen objects using surface estimates from a single camera view. Further, our approach outperforms a state of the art multi-fingered grasp planner, while also beating several baselines we propose.",Deep learning in grasping and manipulation | grasping | multifingered hands,2,0,repositoryam,Green,NSF,1846341,National Science Foundation

Compared with existing approaches, the novelty of this paper is twofold. 1. Using a LiDAR to collect the environmental point cloud information of the kiwifruit orchard and construct a two-dimensional grid map. In the process of constructing the map, the fruit coordinate information is collected in real time, and the fruit coordinates are projected onto the grid map to obtain the distribution of kiwifruit in the orchard environment. Combined with the effective picking area of a kiwifruit picking robot, a kiwifruit area division algorithm is proposed, which converts the traditional grid-based coverage path planning into a travelling salesman (TSP) problem of solving the traversal order of each area. 2. An improved deep reinforcement learning algorithm, the re-DQN algorithm, is proposed to solve the traversal order of each region. The model training results show that the algorithm is more effective than the traditional DQN algorithm, completing model convergence to a better solution. The experimental results of kiwifruit orchard navigation show that the coverage path length of the method proposed in this paper is 220.67 m, which is 31.56 % shorter than that of the boustrophedon algorithm. The overall navigation time is 1200 s, which is 35.72 % shorter than that of the boustrophedon algorithm.

Leveraging GPU parallelization and the differentiable nature of the proposed distance function allows for fast calculation of gradients with respect to the neural network inputs, providing a continuous repulsive vector field directly in joint space. We show that the learned high-resolution collision representation can be used to achieve real-time reactive control by i) formulating it as a collision-avoidance constraint for a quadratic programming (QP) inverse kinematics (IK), and ii) introducing it as a collision cost in a sampling-based joint space model predictive controller (MPC).

In this paper, we present a novel framework for modeling, configuring and enacting the cooperative behaviors of MRSs through collaboration diagrams as provided by the BPMN 2.0 standard.

Starting from the selection of BPMNelements, we define a set of guidelines for driving the developer in modeling an MRS mission using BPMN. The developer configures the resulting collaboration diagram to link elements in the model to the robotic middleware, ROS2 in the toolchain we implemented. Finally, the configured model is enacted by BPMN engines integrated into the ROS2 middleware run by each robot involved in the MRS, thus obtaining a fully distributed cooperation.

It plays an essential role in the machinery manufacturing industry. At the moment, in most industries, welding robots still work by teaching and payback. When the welding object or conditions change, the robot cannot make corresponding adjustments in time, which makes the welding gun deviate from the weld center, resulting in the decline of welding quality. The realization of automatic and intelligent welding is the inevitable development trend in the future. The application of machine vision in the welding field will promote the transformation of welding technology from rigid welding automation to flexible welding intelligence. Welding automation and intelligence are intended to improve the working conditions and environment, reduce labor costs, and improve product quality. Robotic welding technology is known for its great efficiency and consistent quality. A four-step welding seam tracking system is suggested based on segmented scanning, filtering, feature points extraction, and path planning. Through the laser sensor installed at the end of the welding robot, the welding seam data is continuously collected in multiple segments in a segmented scanning manner. To improve the tracking accuracy, a combined filtering method is used to correct the data to reduce the effects of burrs, data distortion, and noise on the surface of the weldment. Then the feature points are collected, and the coordinate system is calibrated in order to identify the welding points. Finally, the spatial welding path is obtained by path planning. Two-dimensional type S and three-dimensional complex welding experimental investigations are carried out. The results show that the proposed method can form a complete welding path. The average errors of the two weldments are about 0.296 mm and 0.292 mm, respectively, which are close enough to fulfill the required accuracy of 0.5 mm.

Given the robot's position, the map aims to reliably assess the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of collision with obstacles whose movements are inferred by Gaussian process regression (GPR). Unfortunately, the inferred distribution is subject to errors, making it difficult to accurately evaluate the CVaR of collision. To overcome this challenge, our tool measures the risk under the worst-case distribution in a so-called ambiguity set that characterizes allowable distribution errors. To resolve the infinite-dimensionality issue inherent in the construction of the DR-risk map, we derive a tractable semidefinite programming formulation that provides an upper bound of the risk, exploiting techniques from modern distributionally robust optimization. As a concrete application for motion planning, a distributionally robust RRT∗ algorithm is considered using the risk map that addresses distribution errors caused by GPR. Furthermore, a motion control method is devised using the DR-risk map in a learning-based model predictive control (MPC) formulation. In particular, a neural network approximation of the risk map is proposed to reduce the computational cost in solving the MPC problem.

The proposed navigational controller is developed by hybridizing the metaheuristic moth-flame optimization (MFO) approach and the reinforcement learning (RL) approach. Input parameters like obstacle and target locations are fed to the MFO controller that implements a proper navigational direction selection. It forwards to the RL controller, which exercises further refinement of the output turning angle around obstacles. The collaboration of the global MFO approach with the local-based RL approach helps to optimize the path traversed by the humanoid robot in an unknown environment. The major breakthrough in this article is the utilization of humanoid robots for navigation purposes between various checkpoints. The humanoid robots are placed in a cluttered environment and assigned specific target positions to complete the assigned tasks. In the case of a multi-humanoid robot system, to avoid self-collision, it requires a Petri-Net controller to be configured in the navigation system to prevent deadlock situations and enhance the smooth completion of tasks without inter-collision among the humanoid robots. Simulations and real-time experiments are undertaken using different controllers involving single- and multi-humanoid robot systems. The robustness of the proposed controller is also validated in dynamic environment. Comparisons are carried with an established navigational controller in a similar environmental setup, which proves the proposed hybrid controller to be robust and efficient.",humanoid robot | moth-flame optimization | path planning | Petri-Net controller | reinforcement learning approach,0,0,,,,undefined,

The risk of network intrusions also rises as a result of these additional connected vulnerabilities. One method for detecting attacks and anomalies in the network is the intrusion detection system (IDS). But an efficient IDS is defined by two characteristics i.e., computational efficiency and classification efficiency with less false alarm rates, which can be achieved by preprocessing network traffic and identification of essential features. A k-nearest neighbor-(KNN) algorithm was used prominently in the development of network IDS due to its better detection rates. But it is very challenging to pick up an appropriate K-value for KNN and especially, when the data classes are imbalanced. Additionally, KNN is a lazy classifier since it does not learn a discriminative function from the training samples instead it memorizes them. This paper focuses on improving existing KNN classifier to achieve classification efficiency and speed in the execution of intrusion detection process. An improvement in shallow KNN is proposed by arranging the attributes of the data in a way that the sample data that is pertinent to distance computation, followed by quantification, and indexing nearest neighbors of the data block. The design and development of the proposed modified KNN driven IDS is carried out using python programming language executed on Anaconda distribution.

In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware, learning-based approach to construct a safe controller such that safety can be guaranteed with a high probability in a complex and unknown environment. Two types of CBFs, namely nominal CBF (NCBF) and uncertainty CBF (UCBF), are constructed by means of Gaussian processes (GPs) based on real-time measurements of the environment. They are then synthesized into an uncertainty-separated control barrier function (US-CBF), which serves as hard constraints in quadratic programming (QP) based controller. To handle the dynamic uncertainties, we exploit another GP to learn the residual dynamics of the robot. The mean prediction is then feedforwarded to the controller such that the residual dynamics can be compensated. The variance function is incorporated into the QP to constrain the trajectory of the robot within a high-confidence safety tube. Moreover, we prove that the solution to the QP is locally Lipschitz continuous, which guarantees a unique solution to the system. Our proposed method demonstrates good performance in addressing safe navigation tasks in highly very complex scenarios provided by the KITTI dataset.

The study of its effects on the polar ice caps and other arctic environments, however, can be hindered by the often dangerous and difficult to navigate terrain found there. Multi-terrain autonomous vehicles can assist researchers by providing a mobile platform on which to collect data in these harsh environments while avoiding any risk to human life and speeding up the research process. The mechanical design and ultimate efficacy of these autonomous robotic vehicles depends largely on the specific missions they are deployed for, but terrain conditions can vary wildly geographically as well as seasonally, making mission planning for these unmanned vehicles more difficult. This paper proposes the use of various UNet-based neural network architectures to generate digital elevation maps from satellite images, and explores and compares their efficacy on a single set of training and validation datasets generated from satellite imagery. These digital elevation maps generated by the model could be used by researchers not only to track the change in arctic topography over time, but to quickly provide autonomous exploratory research rovers with the topographical information necessary to decide on optimal paths during the mission. This paper analyzes different model architectures and training schemes: a traditional UNet, a traditional UNet with data augmentation, a UNet with a single active skip-layer vision transformer (ViT), and a UNet with multiple active skip-layer ViT. Each model was trained on a dataset of satellite images and corresponding digital elevation maps of Ellesmere Island, Canada. Utilizing ViTs did not demonstrate a significant improvement in UNet performance, though this could change with longer training.

A robot exploits knowledge about different obstacle classes and selects the minimally invasive action to perform to clear the path. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN), so the robot can classify an RGB-D image and decide whether to push a blocking object and which force to apply. After known objects are segmented, they are being projected to a cost-map, and a robot calculates an optimal path to the goal. If the blocking objects are allowed to be moved, a robot drives through them while pushing them away. We implemented our algorithm in ROS, and an extensive set of simulations showed that the robot successfully overcomes the blocked regions. Our approach allows a robot to successfully build a path through regions, where it would have stuck with traditional path-planning techniques.",Learning-based | NAMO | Navigation Among Movable Obstacles | Path Planning | Visual Segmentation,0,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

To address these challenges, we present an optimized multi-object tracking pipeline using TensorRT.

We optimized the Yolox neural network used in ByteTrack with TensorRT to produce bounding boxes for each frame.

We evaluate the performance of our approach on the palace.mp4 video dataset, which is used in the ByteTrack demo. Our experimental results show a significant improvement in frame rate, increasing from 10.1fps to 14.3fps, while also reducing memory consumption from 1.4GB to 1.1GB.

Improving the accuracy of autonomous navigation of mobile robots is a hot issue to be solved. However, traditional navigation methods are unable to realize crash-free navigation in an environment with dynamic obstacles, more and more scholars are gradually using autonomous navigation based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to replace overly conservative traditional methods. But on the other hand, DRL's training time is too long, and the lack of long-term memory easily leads the robot to a dead end, which makes its application in the actual scene more difficult. To shorten training time and prevent mobile robots from getting stuck and spinning around, we design a new robot autonomous navigation framework which combines the traditional global planning and the local planning based on DRL. Therefore, the entire navigation process can be transformed into first using traditional navigation algorithms to find the global path, then searching for several high-value landmarks on the global path, and then using the DRL algorithm to move the mobile robot toward the designated landmarks to complete the final navigation, which makes the robot training difficulty greatly reduced. Furthermore, in order to improve the lack of long-term memory in deep reinforcement learning, we design a feature extraction network containing memory modules to preserve the long-term dependence of input features. Through comparing our methods with traditional navigation methods and reinforcement learning based on end-to-end depth navigation methods, it shows that while the number of dynamic obstacles is large and obstacles are rapidly moving, our proposed method is, on average, 20% better than the second ranked method in navigation efficiency (navigation time and navigation paths' length), 34% better than the second ranked method in safety (collision times), 26.6% higher than the second ranked method in success rate, and shows strong robustness.",autonomous navigation | deep reinforcement learning (DRL) | mobile robots | simultaneous localization and mapping | trajectory planning,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

One critical aspect of their operation is effective local path planning, which considers dynamic constraints. In this context, the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) has been widely recognized as a robust local path planning. DWA produces a set of path candidates derived from velocity space subject to dynamic constraints. An optimal path is selected from path candidates through an evaluation function guided by fixed weight coefficients. However, fixed weight coefficients are typically designed for a specific environmental context. Consequently, changes in environmental conditions such as congestion levels, road width, and obstacle density could potentially lead the evaluation function to select inefficient paths or even result in collisions. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes the dynamic weight coefficients based on Q-learning for DWA (DQDWA). The proposed method uses a pre-learned Q-table that comprises robot states, environmental conditions, and actions of weight coefficients. DQDWA can use the pre-learned Q-table to dynamically select optimal paths and weight coefficients that better adapt to varying environmental conditions. The performance of DQDWA was validated through extensive simulations and real experiments to confirm its ability to enhance the effectiveness of local path planning.",Angular velocity | Collision avoidance | collision avoidance | dynamic window approach | mobile robot | Mobile robots | motion planning | Path planning | Path planning | Q-learning | Robot kinematics | Robots,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

However, dimensional deviations from intended values and inadequate surface quality of the built parts limit its wide deployment. The present work reports the development of an adaptive tool path trajectory platform to correct the dimensional inaccuracies in-situ to build high-quality components using LDED. The study deploys a laser line scanner to scan the part after the deposition of the definite number of layers followed by the detection of concave, convex, and flat surfaces using deep learning. Further, a novel adaptive trajectory planning algorithm is deployed by using three different strategies to control material deposition on concave, convex, and flat surfaces. The material deposition is controlled by using adaptive scanning speed control (ASSC), and a combination of laser on–off and scanning speed control (ASSLC). Subsequently, the built geometries are subjected to geometric, microstructure, and mechanical characterizations. It is observed that the deviation of the part was reduced by 30%, and 27.5% using ASSC and ASSLC, respectively. The structures built using the three strategies show some micropores at isolated locations. The microstructure is mainly cellular under all conditions with a similar average microhardness of ~ 210 HV. The study provides an integrated and comprehensive approach for building high-quality large-scale components using LDED with minimal dimensional deviation from the original CAD model.",Additive manufacturing | Characterization | Computational geometry | Deep learning | In-situ monitoring | Robotic laser directed energy deposition | Surface defect detection,0,0,,,,undefined,Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario

However, for high-dimensional learning tasks in complex scenes, the exploration and stable training capabilities of the robot still need enhancement. In light of policy planning and policy optimization, we propose a bidirectional model-based policy optimization algorithm based on adaptive gaussian noise and improved confidence weights (BMPO-NW). The algorithm parameterizes bidirectional policy networks into noise networks by adding different adaptive Gaussian noises to the connection weights and biases. This can improve the randomness of policy search and induce efficient exploration for the robot. Simultaneously, the confidence weight of improved activation function is introduced into the Q-function update formula of SAC, which can reduce the error propagation problem of target Q-network, and enhance the robot's training stability. Finally, we implement the improved algorithm based on the framework of bidirectional model-based policy optimization algorithm (BMPO) to ensure asymptotic performance and sample efficiency. Experimental results in MuJoCo benchmark environments demonstrate that the learning speed of BMPO-NW is about 20% higher than baseline methods, the average reward is about 15% higher than other MBRL methods, and 50%-70% higher than MFRL methods, while the training process is more stable. Ablation experiments and different variant design experiments further verify the feasibility and robustness.

We consider two complementary scenarios: for simpler sparse environments, we formulate the Quantum Full Path Search Algorithm (q-FPS), which creates a superposition of full random path solutions, manipulates probability amplitudes with Quantum Amplitude Amplification (QAA), and quantum measures a single obstacle free full path solution. For dense unstructured environments, we formulate the Quantum Rapidly Exploring Random Tree algorithm, q-RRT, that creates quantum superpositions of possible parent-child connections, manipulates probability amplitudes with QAA, and quantum measures a single reachable state, which is added to a tree. As performance depends on the number of oracle calls and the probability of measuring good quantum states, we quantify how these errors factor into the probabilistic completeness properties of the algorithm. We then numerically estimate the expected number of database solutions to provide an approximation of the optimal number of oracle calls in the algorithm. We compare the q-RRT algorithm with a classical implementation and verify quadratic run-time speedup in the largest connected component of a 2D dense random lattice.

However, we have a chance to improve the results if we allow planning to consume detection signals and move the robot to collect views that maximize the quality of the results. In this paper, we use reinforcement learning (RL) methods to control the robot in order to obtain images that maximize the detection quality.

Recent progress in unsupervised skill discovery algorithms has shown great promise in learning an extensive collection of behaviors without extrinsic supervision. On the other hand, safety is one of the most critical factors for real- world robot applications. As skill discovery methods typically encourage exploratory and dynamic behaviors, it can often be the case that a large portion of learned skills remain too dangerous and unsafe. In this paper, we introduce the novel problem of Safety-Aware Skill Discovery, which aims to learn, in a task-agnostic fashion, a repertoire of reusable skills that are inherently safe to be composed for solving downstream tasks. We present a computationally tractable algorithm that learns a latent-conditioned skill policy that maximizes intrinsic rewards regularized with a safety-critic that can model any user-defined safety constraints.

The use of hand gestures for controlling robots offers several advantages over traditional methods, such as programming or using a joystick. It is a natural and intuitive way to interact with the robot, reducing the need for extensive training and simplifying the programming process. It also allows for greater flexibility in the use of the robot, as it can respond quickly to changes in the environment and adapt to new tasks. In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing hand gesture recognition systems that can accurately interpret human gestures and translate them into robot commands. These systems typically use cameras or other sensors to capture the hand movements, and machine learning algorithms to recognize and classify the gestures. One of the key challenges in industrial robot manipulation using hand gestures is ensuring that the system is robust and reliable in different environments and under different lighting conditions. This requires careful calibration and testing.In this proposed model, we have used accelerometer sensor (ADXL345) as a tool for detecting the hand gestures and we have used NODEMCU ESP8266 for the communication between the accelerometer sensor and the robot controller.

The vibration through physical interaction is a common problem in such settings, especially in operations involving hand-held vibrating tools. The existing human-robot collaboration (HRC) works addressing this problem mostly focus on the oscillations caused by the human operator, and suppress them by adapting the admittance parameters. This, however, usually results in stiffer robot behavior and contributes to reducing the overall performance of the task, in particular when impedance planning is a requirement. In this work, we focus on the vibration coming from external sources such as power tools and suppress it actively. We learn the vibration using the bandlimited multiple Fourier linear combiner (BMFLC) algorithm and apply it as a feedforward Cartesian force to cancel the vibration. We combine the feedforward force control with variable impedance learning and show that it improves the vibration suppression performance in simulation and real-world experiments. The feedforward approach can suppress the vibration better while keeping a more compliant set of impedance parameters, which is crucial in HRC.",,0,0,repositoryam,Green,,101016007,

Choosing the order of grasps to perform, and corresponding tool-change actions, can improve system throughput; this is the topic of our work. The main challenge in planning tool change is uncertainty - we typically cannot see objects in the bin that are currently occluded. Inspired by queuing and admission control problems, we model the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the goal is to maximize expected throughput, and we pursue an approximate solution based on model predictive control, where at each time step we plan based only on the currently visible objects. Special to our method is the idea of void zones, which are geometrical boundaries in which an unknown object will be present, and therefore cannot be accounted for during planning. Our planning problem can be solved using integer linear programming (ILP). However, we find that an approximate solution based on sparse tree search yields near optimal performance at a fraction of the time. Another question that we explore is how to measure the performance of tool-change planning: we find that throughput alone can fail to capture delicate and smooth behavior, and propose a principled alternative.

Therefore, a key challenge for autonomous in-hand tool manipulation is finding a sequence of grasps that facilitates every step of the tool use process while continuously maintaining force closure and stability. Due to the complexity of modeling the contact dynamics, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques can provide a solution in this continuous space subject to highly parameterized physical models. However, these techniques impose a trade-off in adaptability and data efficiency. At test time the tool properties, desired trajectory, and desired application forces could differ substantially from training scenarios. Adapting to this necessitates more data or computationally expensive online policy updates.

Specifically, we first design a computationally simple approximation of our environment. We then demonstrate in physical simulation that performing tree searches (i.e., lookaheads) and policy rollouts with this approximation can improve an RL-derived grasp sequence policy with minimal additional online computation.

The leader robot determines the desired trajectory while the follower robots track the motion of the leader robot using a control system. However, this hierarchical architecture does not ensure successful obstacle avoidance for follower robots. Several solutions proposed adding an obstacle avoidance layer, but this can increase the system complexity and reduce the computational speed, hindering real-time performance. Improving the opposing attributes, namely the execution speed, path length, safety, and smoothness, together is a challenging path-planning problem in robotics. This paper proposes a novel leader-follower control mechanism that combines formation control and obstacle avoidance in one step. The new path planning technique focuses on enhancing execution speed and safety while ensuring the generation of smooth paths with acceptable path lengths. The main contribution of the proposed technique lies in the development of a novel potential field modeling approach specifically designed for follower robots in a multi-robot system. The proposed potential field model consists of three terms, namely, the Gaussian term, the Euclidean term, and the Logarithmic term, which are all optimized later using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to generate the path. The Gaussian term, acting as a repulsive force, represents the Gaussian distance to each obstacle in the environment. It exhibits a strong value in close proximity to obstacles, while it gradually decays exponentially as the distance from the obstacles increases. The second term, the Euclidean term, which is the Euclidean distance to the leader robot, is responsible to find the shortest path to the leader robot. Finally, to ensure follower robot safety, a logarithmic term is integrated into the potential field model, facilitating automatic switching between attractive and repulsive forces generated by the leader robot. The incorporation of a logarithmic term into the potential field model stands as a significant innovation in the proposed technique. This inclusion enables the leader robot to generate an initial attractive force towards the followers, which dynamically transitions into a repulsive force as the follower robots approach. This automatic switching behavior enhances processing efficiency while ensuring collision avoidance. A kinematic control strategy is applied to the system in order to test the proposed path planning technique. The experimental results have proven the effectiveness of the proposed system, which has shown superior performance over the well-known techniques A∗, RRT∗, PRM, and also Hybrid-A∗ in terms of execution speed and the path length.",kinematic control | leader-follower | Multi-robot | path planning | potential field,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

Besides, they just output simple binary result, which ignores the key artificial statement information in the log. In this paper, we propose Triple, an interpretable anomaly detection approach based on deep learning for microservice system. More importantly, Triple aims to help engineers to establish trust in the system decision from key metrics and the artificial statements in logs. Triple leverages graph representation to describe the complicated dependency relationship in the traces with the logs and metrics embedded into the node features. Based on the graph representation, Triple trains a Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network(STGCN) to capture the key information and generate decision boundary by deep SVDD, which detects the system's anomaly. In addition, we design an interpreter to transfer the simple binary result into a humanly understandable result, including log, metrics and trace, to facilitate engineers' understanding and handling of the incoming incident. Our work has four aims. First, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to simultaneously apply three data sources to finish anomaly detection in the domain. Second, we design a new anomaly detection method that is an STGCN based on SVDD. Third, we design an interpreter that makes the decision not only a simple binary result. The interpretable result could capture the key artificial statement information in the log and assist engineers in incident troubleshooting. Finally, we design a series experiments to validate our method's effectiveness in the real-world system's dataset.

Firstly, we retrieve the nonconvex obstacles with arbitrary probabilistic uncertainties in the form of a deterministic point cloud map. A neural network sampler encodes it into a latent embedding and is trained with sufficient expert demonstrations, predicting states in the potential subspace. We construct a neural cost estimator to select the best informed state from those samples.

Building on previous work, the newly developed algorithm can solve more generalized problems, which involve required minimum payload restrictions on each task. The heterogeneous multi-robot systems consist of robots with different average running speeds and maximum payloads. The proposed heuristic considers workload balancing between the robots to provide a feasible solution satisfying all constraints.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are often used for image processing DL applications. Modern CNN models are growing to meet the needs of more sophisticated tasks, e.g. using Transposed Convolutions (TCONVs) for image decompression and image generation. Such state-of-the-art DL models often target GPU-based high-performance architectures, due to the high computational and hardware resource needs of TCONV layers. To avoid prohibitive GPU energy costs, CNNs are increasingly deployed to decentralized embedded autonomous devices, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). However, this poses challenges for designing efficient hardware implementations of TCONV layers. This paper presents a parameterized design and implementation of a new TCONV module, which is synthesizable onto FPGAs. It is implemented using the High-Level Synthesis (HLS), through a C++ template to parameterize its functional and non-functional properties. These parameters allow kernel sizes, image sizes, quantization and parallelism to be varied by users. With a systematic exploration in this design space, we find an optimal instance of this TCONV module that achieves 6.25 Giga Outputs per Second (Gout/s) using just 1.53 W of power. We then use our TCONV layer in two neural networks for image decompression and image generation. Image decompression achieves a speed throughput of more than 30K frames-per-second (fps) using only the 16% of resources on average, image generation achieves an energy efficiency of 324 fps/W and outperforms comparable state-of-the-art models by at least 7.3×.",Deep Learning | FPGA | High-Level Synthesis | Parallelism | Quantization | Transposed Convolution,0,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,MIUR,undefined,"Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca"

However, most educational results of this instructional method have been achieved in face-to-face educational settings and less has been said about how to promote AL and experimentation for online engineering education. Then, the main aim of this study was to create an AL methodology to learn electronics, physical computing (PhyC), programming, and basic robotics in engineering through hands-on activities and active experimentation in online environments. N = 56 students of two engineering programs (Technology in Electronics and Industrial Engineering) participated in the methodology that was conceived using the guidelines of the integrated course design model (ICDM) and in some courses combining mobile and online learning with an Android app. The methodology gathered three main components: (1) In-home laboratories performed through low-cost hardware devices, (2) Student-created videos and blogs to evidence the development of skills, and (3) Teacher support and feedback. Data in the courses were collected through surveys, evaluation rubrics, semistructured interviews, and students' grades and were analyzed through a mixed approach. The outcomes indicate a good perception of the PhyC and programming activities by the students and suggest that these influence motivation, self-efficacy, reduction of anxiety, and improvement of academic performance in the courses. Even, the PhyC activities can reduce the differences in academic performance between women and male students and promote their improvement toward excellence with better results for courses combining online and mobile learning. Similarly, women students preferred to use more often tutoring services and had a better perception of the teacher's feedback than their male pairs.

Developing an embedded system presents several challenges. First, the development often involves configuring hardware that requires domain-specific knowledge. Second, the library for the hardware may have API usage patterns that must be followed. To overcome such challenges, we propose a framework called ArduinoProg towards the automatic generation of Arduino applications. ArduinoProg takes a natural language query as input and outputs the configuration and API usage pattern for the hardware described in the query. Motivated by our findings on the characteristics of real-world queries posted in the official Arduino forum, we formulate ArduinoProg as three components, i.e., Library Retriever, Configuration Classifier, and Pattern Generator. First, Library Retriever preprocesses the input query and retrieves a set of relevant libraries using either lexical matching or vector-based similarity. Second, given Library Retriever's output, Configuration Classifier infers the hardware configuration by classifying the method definitions found in the library's implementation files into a hardware configuration class. Third, Pattern Generator also takes Library Retriever's output as input and leverages a sequence-to-sequence model to generate the API usage pattern. Having instantiated each component of ArduinoProg with various machine learning models, we have evaluated ArduinoProg on real-world queries. Library Retriever achieves a Precision@K range of 44.0%-97.1%; Configuration Classifier achieves an Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.79-0.95; Pattern Generator yields a Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)@K of 0.45-0.73.

For that purpose, a simple artificial language was used and a systemic model of language communication. The robot, which was implemented through a computer simulation, is initially taught both the artificial language and the systemic model of human communication. The main goal of improvement was to allow a robot using the implied information of incoming sentences and ask questions whenever the given instructions are not complete. This process was based on the voids of an output data structure that corresponds to a systemic model of language communication, augmented with hole semantics, as grammar formalism, in order to handle partial/incomplete information. As expected, the improvement of learning abilities was observed. Some problems were also noticed in the process that had to be handled. This research comes to redefine the project in relation to these problems, as well as the final form of the language that was planned to be used. The usage of a dictionary of approximately 200 words in Greek natural language, the interchange of the programming language from Java to Python, as well as a new word learning procedures, are the new points in this paper. New words help the robot to expand the initial dictionary. The learning procedures start at the moment that a unknown word, included in a sentence addressed to the robot, arrives in its hearing input system. In addition, Python is an evolving programming language in various artificial intelligence's applications.

This quantitative study utilized repeated measures through pre-, post-, and 6-month follow-up surveys and tests. The findings indicated the pre-service teachers’ programming comprehension gains exhibited on the posttest deteriorated substantially to near-baseline levels within 6 months of instruction. Conversely, pre-service teachers’ motivation related to programming continued to rise after the instruction had concluded.

On the other hand, DRL (Deep Reinforcement Learning) has shown remarkable results in dealing with complex environments, generalizing new problem instances, and solving motion planning problems efficiently. On that account, this paper proposes a Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-based motion planner for robotic manipulators. We propose an easily reproducible method to train an agent in randomized scenarios achieving generalization for unknown environments. We evaluated our model against state-of-The-Art sampling-and DRL-based planners in several experiments containing static and dynamic obstacles. Results show the adaptability of our agent in new environments and the superiority in terms of path length and execution time compared to conventional methods.

On the one hand, more data will lead to faster learning of the behavioral policy. On the other hand, agents equipped with different sensors will need more computing power to process the data, thus requiring more robust equipment and increasing the cost of implementation. In addition, the complexity of the algorithms increases as different types of data, i.e., data with different structures, have to be synchronized. Therefore, this paper addresses the problem of homogenization and synchronization of data provided by heterogeneous sensors. Furthermore, it presents a novel method of estimating data in order to provide the agent with a 360-degree view of the environment, similar to that provided by a laser. The method's performance compares the different behavioral policies obtained by different viewing angles of a camera with the policy obtained by a laser. The data obtained from the different viewing angles of each sensor are used in a path planning algorithm, which was designed to use a single 24-scan laser as an input source. The results show that the proposed method is robust since the behavior policies can be reused regardless of the viewing angle with which the sensor (camera) is provided. Furthermore, the proposed novel algorithm achieves an average efficiency of 68% and 94% using a 90 and 360-degree camera, respectively.",Artificial intelligence | heterogeneous data | homogeneous data | interpolation | laser scan | point cloud | reinforcement learning,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

On the other hand, federated learning (FL), which focuses on privacy protection, also faces challenges such as core network congestion and limited mobile device (MD) resources. The computation offloading technology of mobile edge computing (MEC) can effectively alleviate these challenges, but it ignores the effect of user mobility and the unpredictable MEC environment. In this paper, we first propose an architecture that combines digital twin (DT) and MEC technology with the FL framework, where the DT network can virtually imitate the statue of physical entities (PEs) and network topology to be used for real-time data analysis and network resource optimization. The computation offloading technology of MEC is used to alleviate resource constraints of MDs and the core network congestion. We further leverage the FL to construct DT models based on PEs&#x2019; running data. Then, we jointly optimize the problem of computation offloading and resource allocation to reduce the straggler effect in FL based on the framework. Since the solution of the objective function is a stochastic programming problem, we model a markov decision process (MDP), and use the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to solve this objective function.

Unlike sampling based motion planners, optimal policies computed by them provide feedback motion plans which eliminates the need for re-computing (optimal) trajectories when a robot starts from a different initial configuration each time. In related studies, an optimal policy (actor) and the associated value function (critic) are usually calculated preforming training in a simulation environment. During training, RL allows learning by interactions with the environment in a physically realistic manner. However, in a simulation system, it is possible to make physically unimplementable moves. Thus, instead of RL, one can make use of Dynamic Programming approaches such as Value Iteration for computing optimal policies, which does not require an exploration component and known to have better convergence properties. In addition, dimension of a value function is smaller than that of a Q-fuction, thereby lessening the severity of the curse of dimensionality. Motivated by these facts, the aim of this paper is to employ Value Iteration algorithm for motion planning of robot manipulators and elaborate its effectiveness compared to a popular RL method, Q-learning.",Dynamic Programming | Manipulators | Motion Planning | Q-Learning,0,0,,,,undefined,

The environment perception system of autonomous intelligent robot is responsible for obtaining the internal state and external environment information of the robot, which is the basis of robot decision-making and planning. By installing a variety of sensors on the autonomous intelligent robot, and using the information fusion method to fuse the obtained information, a consistent description of the environment is obtained. The key to the architecture of autonomous intelligent robots is to seek the best compromise between precise reasoning and fast response. With the development of sensor and computer technology, the research on environment perception based on multi-sensor information fusion will be more in-depth and more achievements will appear. Environment perception, motion control and interactive recognition are the core technology modules of robot industry development, among which perception is the precondition of robot motion and interactive recognition. Through visual detection of the target features, the offset of the target relative to the reference position can be obtained, and the working trajectory of the robot can be compensated to solve the problem of accurate target positioning, and a good man-machine interaction channel can be constructed through speech recognition technology. Supported by external sensors, the robot has the ability to perceive the external environment to varying degrees, and has certain ability of environment modeling and decision-making control. Perception system is the most important part of the interaction between intelligent robot and human and external environment. This paper expounds the idea of evolutionary control and applies it to the design of the control structure of autonomous intelligent robots. This structure enables the mobile robot to have good learning and adaptability, fast response speed, good rationality and ability to complete a given task.",Integrated system | Intelligent robot | Multi-perception,0,0,,,,undefined,

LLMs planning in embodied environments need to consider not just what skills to do, but also how and when to do them - answers that change over time in response to the agent's own choices. In this work, we investigate to what extent LLMs used in such embodied contexts can reason over sources of feedback provided through natural language, without any additional training. We propose that by leveraging environment feedback, LLMs are able to form an inner monologue that allows them to more richly process and plan in robotic control scenarios. We investigate a variety of sources of feedback, such as success detection, scene description, and human interaction.

Our approach, Active Visual Planning (AVP), uses high-dimensional observations to learn a flow-based generative model of multi-agent joint trajectories, including unobserved agents that may be revealed in the near future, depending on the robot's actions. Our predictive model is implemented using deep neural networks that map raw observations to future detection and pose trajectories and is learned entirely offline using a dataset of recorded observations (not ground-truth states). Once learned, our predictive model can be used for contingency planning over the potential existence, intentions, and positions of unobserved agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AVP on a set of autonomous driving environments inspired by real-world scenarios that require reasoning about the existence of other unobserved agents for safe and efficient driving.

Instead of assuming full prediction coverage that robust planners require, we propose to make prediction itself risk-aware. We introduce a new prediction objective to learn a risk-biased distribution over trajectories, so that risk evaluation simplifies to an expected cost estimation under this biased distribution.

The trained CRNN can find the shortest path from the starting point to the goal point by evaluating map images in one go. Additionally, the CRNN can predict way-points on image inputs. Our simulation results demonstrate that our proposed strategy is capable of finding the shortest path much faster than the A* algorithm in sparse environments, achieving a speed-up of up to 831 in some cases, which is exceptional.",A* | Adaptive Autonomy | CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) | data-driven-based | Deep learning | Machine learning | Path Planning,0,0,,,,undefined,

In popular use, artificial intelligence refers to the ability of a computer or machine to mimic the ability of the human mind to learn from examples and experiences, recognize objects, understand and respond to language, make decisions, solve problems, and combine these and other abilities to perform functions that humans might perform. Artificial intelligence requires experience and data to smarten up the technology. The most important things in making artificial intelligence are learning, reasoning, and self-correction. At the learning stage, AI gives machines the ability to learn tasks without requiring a defined programming language. Then, the reasoning stage is the stage where the reason AI is applied in a technology. The self-correction stage is the stage where the AI is refining itself from and learning from experience in order to minimize errors or problems that exist. Then, this matter is concerned with the parking lot to be discussed. Parking can be interpreted as public facilities available in agencies or offices that serve to store vehicles. Vehicles entering the parking area become tens or even thousands, because it requires a parking system and management area. Such arrangements are capable of parking procedures and even other support systems such as adequate parking facilities and infrastructure, and another function is to create and develop parking systems in general to provide safety and comfort. The methodology obtained from this problem is checking the research model to check and find out the comparison of vehicle user’s Parking System Security between cars or motorcycles, as well as the usual parking lots visited. Then, we created a questionnaire. This study used questionnaires with the aim to get respondents’ results about the Parking Security System.

When the environments are unknown, prior motion planning for navigation may not always be available. This paper presents a novel Sim-to-Real method to guide a cable-driven soft robot in a static environment under the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA). The scenario aims to resemble one of the steps during a simplified transoral tracheal intubation process where a robotic endotracheal tube is guided to the upper trachea-larynx location by a flexible video-assisted endoscope/stylet. In SOFA, we employ the quadratic programming inverse solver to obtain collision-free motion strategies for the endoscope/stylet manipulation based on the robot model and encode the virtual eye-in-hand vision. Then, we associate the anatomical features recognized by the virtual vision and the joint space motion using a closed-loop nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model (NARX) network. Afterward, we transfer the learned knowledge to the robot prototype, expecting it to navigate to the desired spot in a new phantom environment automatically based on its eye-in-hand vision only. Experiment results indicate that our soft robot can efficaciously navigate through the unstructured phantom to the desired spot with minimal collision motion according to what it has learned from the virtual environment. The results show that the average R-squared coefficient between the closed-loop NARX-forecasted and SOFA-referenced robot&#x0027;s cable and prismatic joint space motion are 0.963 and 0.997, respectively.

Firstly, the robot operation environments were described as a grid map and divided into several grid sub-maps. The topological framework was obtained by extracting the location relation of the sub-maps as the key nodes, and the local region of grid maps was represented elaborately to construct a hybrid topology-grid-metric map. Then, the robot’s path was planned hierarchically in the different regions of the hybrid map. Floyd algorithm was used to plan the interregional path between sub-regions on the topology map. An improved A* algorithm was proposed to search the intraregional paths of each sub-map for the grid map. The filtering strategy of extension points, the mechanism of bidirectional search, and the elimination technique of redundant waypoints were introduced to improve the efficiency and quality of path planning. And the globally optimized initial path was generated by merging several interregional and intraregional paths. Finally, a dynamic obstacle-avoidance path planning method was proposed based on the deep reinforcement learning framework for the dynamic obstacles in a partly unknown environment on the metric map. In the framework, the mechanism of value-classified experience replay was devised to increase the utilization of experience samples and the efficiency of model training.

Hand engineered approaches might work in constrained environments, but learning-based approaches may prove to be superior owing to their greater generalization. In this work, a simple reinforcement learning technique has been designed for the biped robot's real-time gait planning. The bipedal walking is a process in which the robot constantly engages with its surroundings, evaluates the effectiveness of its control actions based on how it is moving, and then modifies its control approach accordingly. The continuous state space and action space are obtained using the Actor-Critic Model (ACM) reinforcement learning method, which also directly determines the robot's final gait without using the reference gait. In order to decrease the amount of actual robot training, speed up training, and guarantee the acquisition of the final gait, the trained model is transferred to the walking control of the actual robot. Finally, a biped robot is created and constructed to test the viability of the suggested approach.

Waste handling applications differ from milling in manufacturing processes, as they engender considerable variety and uncertainty in the parameters (e.g. hardness) of materials which the robot must cut. To address this challenge, we propose a learning-based approach incorporating elements of interaction control, in which the robot can adapt key parameters, such as feed rate, depth of cut, and mechanical compliance during task execution. We show how a mathematical model of cutting mechanics, embedded in a simulation environment, can be used to rapidly train the system without needing large amounts of data from physical cutting trials. The simulation approach was validated on a real robot setup based on four case study materials with varying structural and mechanical properties. We demonstrate the proposed method minimises process force and path deviations to a level similar to offline optimal planning methods, while the average time to complete a cutting task is within 25% of the optimum, at the expense of reduced volume of material removed per pass. A key advantage of our approach over similar works is that no prior knowledge about the material is required. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;This work is motivated by challenges in emerging fields such as recycling of electric vehicles, where products such as batteries adopt a range of designs with varying physical geometry and materials. More generally, this applies when considering robotic disassembly of any unknown component where semi-destructive operations such as cutting are required. Product-to-product variation introduces challenges when planning cutting processes required to disassemble a component, as contemporary planning approaches typically require advance knowledge of the material properties, shape and desired path to select tool speed, feed and depth of cut. In this paper, we show a mathematical model of milling force embedded in a simulation environment can be used as a relatively inexpensive approach to simulate a broad spectrum of cutting processes the robot may encounter. This allows the robot to learn from experience a strategy that can select these key parameters of a milling task online without user assistance. We develop a framework for controlling a robot using this strategy that allows the stiffness of the robot arm to be modulated over time to best satisfy metrics of productivity (e.g. required cutting time), while maintaining safe interaction of the robot with its environment (e.g. by avoiding force limits), similarly to how a human operator can vary muscular tension to accomplish different tasks. We posit that the proposed method can substitute a trial-and-error strategy of selecting process parameters for disassembly of novel products, or integrated with existing planning approaches to adjust the parameters of milling tasks online.",Aerospace electronics | energy tank | interaction control | Milling | passivity-based control | Process control | Reinforcement learning | robotic milling | Robots | Solid modeling | Task analysis | Uncertainty,0,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

As is well known, humans perceive uncertainty and risk in a biased way, which can lead to a diversity of actions and expectations when interacting with others. To gain a better understanding of these behaviors, this work presents new data that aims to verify how these biases translate into a human navigational setting. More precisely, we conduct a novel study that recreates a COVID-19 pandemic grocery shopping scenario and asks participants to select among various paths with different levels of time-risk tradeoffs. The data shows that participants exhibit a variety of path preferences: from risky and urgent to safe and relaxed. To model users&#x0027; decision making, we evaluate three popular risk models (Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), Conditional Value at Risk (CVAR), and Expected Risk (ER). We find that CPT captures people&#x0027;s decisions more accurately than CVaR and ER, corroborating previous theoretical results that CPT is more expressive and inclusive than CVaR and ER.

For a robot manipulator with an eye-on-hand configuration, visibility constraint is an essential requirement to avoid servo failure, while robot&#x2019;s actuator limits must also be satisfied. To ensure this, the constraints are modelled implicitly via learning the task and defining safe regions using expert human demonstrations via mixture of Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs). The visual servoing problem is then formulated as a closed-loop optimal control problem using these constraint model where a desired target (possibly time-varying) is obtained by acting upon the feedback from the real-time visual sensors. The visual servo control loop consists of a single network adaptive critic optimal tracking control scheme whose weights are tuned using Lyapunov stability criteria. The stability and the performance of the proposed control scheme is shown theoretically via Lyapunov approach and also verified experimentally using a seven degree of freedom (DOF) Franka Emika and six DOF Universal Robot (UR) 10 manipulator. The approach is also demonstrated on a use case scenarios in mock-up convenience store and warehouse setup. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;The applications of robots in busy warehouses, healthcare sectors and convenience store, has a big societal impact.

These naturally adds up to the programming costs in addition to the robot platform and actuation. However, modern robots need intuitive and easy programming for more pervasive in a practical societal application. In our proposed method, this sensor-based planning with environmental constraints is modelled implicitly using the Programming by Demonstration framework. The user needs to catch the robot arm by his hand and teach the task at hand, and the framework captures the task and robot constraints while generalizing to new goals.

Dynamic environments with static and dynamic obstacles are challenging areas in robotic implementations. In this proposed study, robotic exploration is presented in an unknown dynamic environment using Random Network Distillation(RND) algorithm, which was introduced for Atari games. RND algorithm is used here for robotic navigation depending on obstacle location and environmental features. The proposed route planning robot is implemented using the Robot Operating System(ROS) and the Gazebo simulator. In previous works, Deep Reinforcement Learning based agents have shown promising outcomes. However, the reward system needs to be more robust for this path-planning task. In order to unravel the sparse reward issue, a revised RND approach is suggested. In order to dynamically alter intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, this algorithm determines the variation of the training steps count in each training episode. Laser inputs from Gazebo are fed to the RND algorithm to get the actions. Actions will define by avoiding walls or obstacles. The robotic path and map are visualized on the Gazebo. The results show the robot's actions and combine intrinsic and extrinsic rewards from RND on the application. Further, employing the RND-trained agent learns to cover environments presented as a novel part of the research. Four simulations are conducted based on the environment to validate the algorithm, including without obstacles, static obstacles, dynamic obstacles, and both.

It was found that AILA was significantly negatively correlated with MLSE. The elementary and junior high school teachers were confident that they could study AI-related courses. However, the AILA of the junior high school teachers was higher than that of the elementary school teachers. Therefore, more teacher training workshops on AI application can be conducted for junior high school teachers to generally improve their familiarity with AI application. Future research can further explore whether teachers will gradually improve their AILA and MLSE with time and as training courses increase.",artificial intelligence education | artificial intelligence learning anxiety | in-service teacher education | learning self-efficacy of machine learning,0,0,,,NSTC,NSTC 111-2410-H-003-168-MY3,National Science and Technology Council

In the light of this, the aim of this case study was to explore young pupils’ descriptions of the concept ‘programming’, in connection with being introduced to programming as a teaching content in technology education. The study is based on semi-structured interviews with 16 children in year 1 (7-year-olds) in a primary school in Sweden. In their descriptions of ‘programming’ as an activity, the pupils mainly used technological descriptions—a theory of artificial mind perspective. However, when they talked about the objects with which they associated programming, psychological descriptions—a theory of mind perspective—were more clearly present. Then, a less pronounced distinction between humans and machines was made. Anthropomorphic references were used, such as when the pupils referenced children’s culture such as movies and television programs. However, the term ‘programming’ was difficult for many of the pupils to grasp. They also had difficulty in finding a function for programming, as well as explanations and arguments for why they learn programming in school. The results of this study indicate that these 7-year-old pupils perceive ‘programming’ as something complex. This at the same time as they describe how programmed and programmed artefacts (including AI devices) are highly present in their everyday lives, in their leisure environments, and in school. This mirrors how technology has become an ‘intelligent’ and active agent, rather than a mere tool in their lives—an aspect that teachers may forget to take advantage of.",Primary school | Programming | Technology education | Theory of artificial mind | Theory of mind,0,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,

The algorithm uses raw camera images as input and directly outputs the manipulator joint velocities. To deal with the partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) problem caused by single image input, we combine the soft actor–critic algorithm with recurrent neural networks. Therefore, the velocity information of the target is introduced to transform the task into a fully observable Markov decision-making process (MDP). Our approach is completely data-driven. It avoids the position and posture estimation of non-cooperative target and the complex modeling motion planning process of FFSM.

We propose a novel approach, Value Iteration Networks with Gated Summarization Module (GS-VIN), which incorporates two main improvements: 1) employing an Adaptive Iteration Strategy in the Value Iteration module to reduce the number of iterations; and 2) introducing a Gated Summarization module to summarize the iterative process. The adaptive iteration strategy uses larger convolution kernels with fewer iteration times, reducing network depth and increasing training stability while maintaining the accuracy of the planning process. The gated summarization module enables the network to emphasize the entire planning process, rather than solely relying on the final global planning outcome, by temporally and spatially resampling the entire planning process within the VI module. We conduct experiments on 2D grid world path-finding problems and the Atari Mr. Pac-man environment, demonstrating that GS-VIN outperforms the baseline in terms of single-step accuracy, planning success rate, and overall performance across different map sizes.

With the distance form of teaching, it was possible to reduce the teaching hours and omit some parts of the study plan. Parts of the subjects often omitted were tied to practical lessons in special facilities, possibly to the use of specific equipment or tools, such as laboratory exercises and experiments, building and construction of robots, programming and physical education. Teachers opted the path of least resistance and often preferred to skip such topics. According to the state educational program in elementary school, it is necessary to develop algorithmic and programming thinking. For this purpose, thematic units focused on algorithmic problem solving and programming are used. The article brings the experience of the authors from the programming of robots in elementary school, which can be equally successfully implemented face-to-face as well as remotely using real or virtual robots. To revive learning and increase its effectiveness, the authors used modern teaching aid and digital educational technologies, which have also proven themselves in the distance form of education. We used virtual and augmented reality, worked in remote laboratories and used implementation of laboratory experiments using visualized simulation models and environments and emulation techniques. The authors report on their experience of teaching programming in primary schools using programmable toys, robots and microcontrollers. Simple tools (buttons marked with symbols) and an interactive environment that offers block or icon programming are used to program the movement and control the activities of such objects—robot toys and own constructed robots. Compiling a functional program does not require high analytical and abstract thinking. The program can be easily and interactively assembled from the offered building elements.

To efficiently optimize such systems, in this paper, we develop a parallel global optimization framework that combines direct search methods with parallel Bayesian optimization. It consists of an iterative global and local search that searches broadly through the entire global space for promising regions and then efficiently exploits each local promising region. We prove the asymptotic convergence properties of the proposed framework and conduct several numerical experiments to illustrate its empirical performance. We also provide a real-time control problem to illustrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;This work is motivated by a collision avoidance problem of vessels aided with onboard agent-based simulations. The simulation on one vessel can predict potential conflicts with other vessels on a pre-defined trajectory. In heavy congestion regions, the environment is highly dynamic and thus it is difficult to find a much safer alternative trajectory if collision is predicted on the current one. Moreover, for such real-time decisions, the control system should be quick in response to improve safety. The proposed metamodel based algorithm is designed for quick decision in such highly dynamic systems. The algorithm employs a decomposition of the response surface to better handle the multi-modal surface resulting from the highly dynamic environment. Specifically, it first looks at the large-scale trend globally (filter out the many local fluctuations that may otherwise trap the algorithm) to locate potential promising regions and then proceeds to this local regions for more detailed local search. To make quick decisions, it uses fast direct search algorithms in the local search phase and applies a parallel search scheme to enjoy the abundant computing power. Both the theoretical analysis and the simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can provide better decisions quickly. We also note that this algorithm is not limited to real-time control or simulation-based system. In the case where each run of the experiment is expensive and the budget is limited for the final decision and when the response function is multi-modal, this algorithm can hopefully become a quite efficient and competitive approach. The multi-modal responses have broad applications in the area of control, planning and operations research, such as robot navigating and reinforcement learning.",Computational modeling | direct search | global and local search | Heuristic algorithms | Linear programming | Numerical models | Optimization | parallel Bayesian optimization | Parallel global optimization | real-time control systems | Real-time systems | Trajectory,0,0,,,,undefined,

It combines Double Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDRL) with Heuristic Knowledge (HK), Experience Replay (ER), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Dynamic Programming (DP), allowing the agent to reach its target successfully without maps. In addition, it optimizes the training time and the chosen path in terms of time and distance to the target. A hybrid method is also used in which Semi-Uniform Distributed Exploration (SUDE) is employed to determine the probability that the action is decided based on directed knowledge, hybrid knowledge, or autonomous knowledge. The performance of DDRL-EG is compared with two other algorithms in two different environments.

This paper provides a short review of the recent developments of deep robotic affordance learning (DRAL), which aims to develop data-driven methods that use the concept of affordance to aid in robotic tasks. We first classify these papers from a reinforcement learning (RL) perspective and draw connections between RL and affordances. The technical details of each category are discussed and their limitations are identified.

The existing OB methods approximately solve the intractable Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation by reinforcement learning (RL) with Bellman residual error, which has intricate actor-critic updating laws and persistence excitation requirement. To overcome this drawback, we construct the simplified RL updating laws by converting the problem to the solution of a positive-definite function, which is composed of actor-critic network weights. Then, the simplified RL updating laws can significantly reduce the controller complexity and relax the persistence excitation. Based on the barrier Lyapunov function, a barrier-type performance index function is constructed for the optimised controller under state constraints. The finite-time stability theory can guarantee the finite-time convergence property of the closed loop system without violating the prescribed constraints.

For ensuring the quality of service (QoS) in IoRT applications, radio resources, for example, transmitting power allocation (PA), interference management, throughput maximization etc., should be efficiently employed and allocated among UE. Traditionally, resource allocation has been formulated using optimization problems, which are then solved using mathematical computer techniques. However, those optimization problems are generally nonconvex as well as nondeterministic polynomial-time hardness (NP-hard). In this paper, one of the most crucial challenges in radio resource management is the emitting power of an antenna called PA, considering that the interfering multiple access channel (IMAC) has been considered. In addition, UE has a natural movement behavior that directly impacts the channel condition between remote radio head (RRH) and UE. Additionally, we have considered two well-known UE mobility models i) random walk and ii) modified Gauss-Markov (GM). As a result, the simulation environment is more realistic and complex. A data-driven as well as model-free continuous action based deep reinforcement learning algorithm called twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) has been proposed that is the combination of policy gradient, actor-critics, as well as double deep Q-learning (DDQL). It optimizes the PA for i) stationary UE, ii) the UE movements according to random walk model, and ii) the UE movement based on the modified GM model.

To facilitate the transfer of human intelligence to legged robots in unstructured environments, this article presents a user-friendly closed-loop shared control framework. The main novelty is that the operator only needs to make decisions based on the recommendations of the autonomous algorithm, without having to worry about operations or consider contact planning issues. Specifically, a rough navigation path from the operator is smoothed and optimized to generate a path with reduced traversing cost. The traversability of the generated path is assessed using fast Monte Carlo tree search, which is subsequently fed back through an intuitive image interface and force feedback to help the operator make decisions quickly, forming a closed-loop shared control. The simulation and hardware experiments on a hexapod robot show that the proposed framework gives full play to the advantages of human&#x2013;machine collaboration and improves the performance in terms of learning time from the operator, mission completion time, and success rate than comparison methods.",Collision avoidance | Costs | Legged locomotion | Legged robots | motion planning | Planning | Robot kinematics | Robot sensing systems | Robots | shared control,0,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The challenges of motion planning in supermarkets lie in the diversity of the supermarket environment, the complexity of obstacle movement, the vastness of the search space. This paper proposes an adaptive Search and Path planning method based on the Semantic information and Deep reinforcement learning (SPSD), which effectively improves the autonomous decision-making ability of supermarket robots. Firstly, based on the backbone of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), supermarket robots process real-Time information from multi-modality sensors to realize high-speed and collision-free motion planning. Meanwhile, in order to solve the problem caused by the uncertainty of the reward in the deep reinforcement learning, common spatial semantic relationships between landmarks and target objects are exploited to define reward function. Finally, dynamics randomization is introduced to improve the generalization performance of the algorithm in the training. The experimental results show that the SPSD algorithm is excellent in the three indicators of generalization performance, training time and path planning length. Compared with other methods, the training time of SPSD is reduced by 27.42% at most, the path planning length is reduced by 21.08% at most, and the trained network of SPSD can be applied to unfamiliar scenes safely and efficiently. The results are motivating enough to consider the application of the proposed method in practical scenes.

However, the rich semantic information of environments is still not fully exploited in previous approaches. In addition, existing methods usually tend to overfit on training scenes or objects in target-driven navigation tasks, making it hard to generalize to unseen environments. Human beings can easily adapt to new scenes as they can recognize the objects they see and reason the possible locations of target objects using their experience. Inspired by this, we propose a DRL-based target-driven navigation model, termed MVC-PK, using Multi-View Context information and Prior semantic Knowledge. It relies only on the semantic label of target objects and allows the robot to find the target without using any geometry map. To perceive the semantic contextual information in the environment, object detectors are leveraged to detect the objects present in the multi-view observations. To enable the semantic reasoning ability of indoor mobile robots, a Graph Convolutional Network is also employed to incorporate prior knowledge. The proposed MVC-PK model is evaluated in the AI2- THOR simulation environment. The results show that MVC-PK (1) significantly improves the cross-scene and cross-target generalization ability, and (2) achieves state-of-the-art performance with 15.2% and 11.0% increase in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), respectively",deep reinforcement learning | graph convolutional network | inteligent robot | visual semantic navigation,0,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,NSFC,62073004,National Natural Science Foundation of China

To address this problem, this study proposes a multi-step motion planner to stably extract an item by using the support relations of each object included in the clutter. This study primarily focuses on safe extraction, which allows the robot to choose the best next action based on limited observations. By estimating the support relations, we construct a collapse prediction graph to obtain the appropriate order of object extraction. Thus, the target object can be extracted without collapsing the pile. Furthermore, we show that the efficiency of the robot is improved if it uses one of its arms to extract the target object while the other supports a neighboring object. The proposed method is evaluated in real-world experiments on detecting support relations and object extraction tasks.

Soft materials afford more flexibility than the rigid materials used in traditional robots, enabling new shapes, sizes, and interactions across a range of applications. From a pedagogical perspective, soft robotics is a good entry point for teaching robotics due to its simplicity and low production costs. Students can get started with programming a robot of their own design in a very short time, which provides a good case study for increasing accessibility in education. For the past five years, we have incorporated studio-based courses on soft robotics in an undergraduate education of Art and Technology, and most recently in a transdisciplinary workshop focused on robots and sustainability. Results from several iterations of the course help to identify key challenges and pedagogical opportunities for developing and teaching transdisciplinary courses in higher education. We contribute guidelines for conducting a successful soft robotics course that supports transdisciplinary teaching and learning activities that foster critical engagement with sustainability. We discuss the integration of different types of knowing and doing, and propose art-based and design-based research methods as useful tools for developing sustainability in transdisciplinary settings. We outline activities that support learning outcomes including digital fabrication, expressive movement, embodied interaction, and design for sustainability. We conclude by mapping future development and open questions linking soft robotics, sustainability, and creative expression with the aim of integrating cultural and sustainable principles throughout the design process.",,0,0,,,,KA203-2020-003,Erasmus+

Fruit and vegetable gardening can provide access to fresh produce, and many gardening activities are considered moderate physical activity. This makes gardening interventions a potential strategy for cardiovascular disease risk reduction. Previously developed gardening interventions have relied on in-person delivery models, which limit scalability and reach. Objective: The purpose of this study was to ascertain participant insight on intervention components and topics of interest to inform a digitally delivered, gardening-focused, multiple health behavior change intervention. Methods: A web-based survey was delivered via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), including quantitative and open-ended questions. Eligible participants were aged ≥20 years, could read and write in English, were US residents, and had at least a 98% MTurk task approval rating. A multilevel screening process was used to identify and exclude respondents with response inattention, poor language fluency, or suspected automated web robots (bots). Participants were asked about their interest in gardening programming, their preferences for intervention delivery modalities (1-hour expert lectures, a series of brief <5-minute videos, or in-person meetings), and what information is needed to teach new gardeners. Comparisons were made between never gardeners (NG) and ever gardeners (EG) in order to examine differences in perceptions based on prior experience. Quantitative data were summarized, and differences between groups were tested using chi-square tests. Qualitative data were coded and organized into intervention functions based on the Behavior Change Wheel. Results: A total of 465 participants were included (n=212, 45.6% NG and n=253, 54.4% EG). There was a high level of program interest overall (n=355, 76.3%), though interest was higher in EG (142/212, 67% NG; 213/253, 84.2% EG; P<.001). The majority of participants (n=282, 60.7%) preferred a series of brief <5-minute videos (136/212, 64.2% NG; 146/253, 57.7% EG; P=.16) over 1-hour lectures (29/212, 13.7% NG; 50/253, 19.8% EG; P=.08) or in-person delivery modes (47/212, 22.2% NG; 57/253, 22.5% EG; P=.93). Intervention functions identified were education and training (performing fundamental gardening and cooking activities), environmental restructuring (eg, social support), enablement (provision of tools or seeds), persuasion (offering encouragement and highlighting the benefits of gardening), and modeling (using content experts and participant testimonials). Content areas identified included the full lifecycle of gardening activities, from the fundamentals of preparing a garden site, planting and maintenance to harvesting and cooking. Conclusions: In a sample of potential web-based learners, participants were interested in a digitally delivered gardening program. They preferred brief videos for content delivery and suggested content topics that encompassed how to garden from planting to harvesting and cooking. The next step in this line of work is to identify target behavior change techniques and pilot test the intervention to assess participant acceptability and preliminary efficacy.",behavior change wheel | cardiovascular health | diet | gardening | intervention development | physical activity,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,NIH,KL2 TR002015,National Institutes of Health

Firstly, A raster map of the surrounding environment was built based on visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology, and A∗ algorithm was used to plan the global path. Secondly, a local path planning strategy based on deep reinforcement learning is constructed by comprehensively considering the problems of obstacle avoidance, robot walking efficiency and pose tracking, and discrete action spaces with forward, left and right turning into basic elements are designed, as well as state Spaces based on visual observations such as color map, depth map and feature point map. Using Proximal Policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to learn and explore the best state action mapping network. The results of Habitat simulation platform show that the proposed local path planning strategy can plan an optimal or suboptimal path on the real-time map.

For practical IWSNs composed of numerous components, the system freshness for a specific task is usually related to multiple and multitype sensing data. For example, in a chemical plant fire alarm system, the system controller (SC) cannot determine the fire notification until analyzing multiple types of ambient information, such as temperature, flame, carbon dioxide, and smoke. However, most existing research on freshness metrics, such as Age of Information (AoI) or Age of Processing (AoP), only considers a single-package setting with a single type of data. Therefore, to measure the system freshness accurately in IWSNs, we propose the Age of Task-oriented Information (AoTI) for industrial tasks. It measures the time elapsed of the latest analyzed results before arriving at the receiver since the generation of any type of sampling data belonging to an industrial task. Considering the time-varying and wireless environments, we aim to minimize the long-term AoTI for IWSNs applications by jointly optimizing access selections and sampling frequencies for all sensors. We first formulate this problem as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem and then transform it into a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), which is further relaxed as an MDP using the Lagrangian method. Finally, we develop a Learning-based Access selection and Sampling frequency Control (LASC) algorithm and verify its superiority through extensive simulations.",access selection | Age of Task-oriented Information (AoTI) | Frequency control | industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) | long-term optimization | Measurement | Quality of service | Robot sensing systems | sampling frequency control | Servers | Task analysis | Wireless sensor networks,0,0,,,,undefined,

The designed VEX autonomous robotic system performed the following tasks: (a) moving around the university classrooms and scanning the body temperature of students and staff, as well as tracking environmental parameters in classrooms; (b) executing sanitation function by disinfecting objects in classrooms; and (c) performing security function by sending an alert signal to health and safety officer if a student or staff with fever enters the classroom, or if staff or student is not wearing face mask indoors. Particle Photon microcontrollers linked to sensors and actuators were used to detect and manage indoor environmental conditions as well as track individuals' body temperatures from a distance, with the data being stored in the ThingSpeak and Particle cloud platforms and displayed on smartphone apps. Transfer learning through MIT App Inventor's Personal Image Classifier was used to detect health protocol violations with 93.33% accuracy. The maximum distance traversed by the robot prototype was 38 meters, with an average time of 220 seconds and an average speed of 0.17 meters per second. The robot had an 88.89% success rate in following the black-lined course.

Contrarily, the traditional Q-learning method, which is a common reinforcement learning approach for local path planning, is unable to complete the task for multiple targets. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a modified Q-learning method, called Vector Field Histogram based Q-learning (VFH-QL) utilized the VFH information in state space representation and reward function, based on a 2D LiDAR sensor. We compared the performance of our proposed method with the classical Q-learning method (CQL) through training experiments that were conducted in a simulated environment with a size of 400 square pixels, representing a 20-meter square map. The environment contained static obstacles and a single mobile robot. Two experiments were conducted: experiment A involved path planning for a single target, while experiment B involved path planning for multiple targets. The results of experiment A showed that VFH-QL method had 87.06% less training time and 99.98% better obstacle avoidance compared to CQL. In experiment B, VFH-QL method was found to have an average training time that was 95.69% less than that of the CQL method and 83.99% better path quality. The VFH-QL method was then evaluated using a benchmark dataset. The results indicated that the VFH-QL exhibited superior path quality, with efficiency of 94.89% and improvements of 96.91% and 96.69% over CQL and SARSA in the task of path planning for multiple targets in unknown environments.",mobile robot | path planning | Q-learning | RL,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,MOHE,9002-00094/9028-00002,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia"

It is difficult for traditional motion planning algorithms to achieve efficient online motion planning in a rapidly changing environment and high-dimensional planning space. The neural motion planning (NMP) algorithm based on reinforcement learning provides a new way to solve the above-mentioned task. Aiming to overcome the difficulty of training the neural network in high-accuracy planning tasks, this article proposes to combine the artificial potential field (APF) method and reinforcement learning. The neural motion planner can avoid obstacles in a wide range; meanwhile, the APF method is exploited to adjust the partial position. Considering that the action space of the manipulator is high-dimensional and continuous, the soft-actor-critic (SAC) algorithm is adopted to train the neural motion planner. By training and testing with different accuracy values in a simulation engine, it is verified that, in the high-accuracy planning tasks, the success rate of the proposed hybrid method is better than using the two algorithms alone. Finally, the feasibility of directly transferring the learned neural network to the real manipulator is verified by a dynamic obstacle-avoidance task.",Artificial potential field (APF) | Heuristic algorithms | hybrid dynamic strategy | Manipulator dynamics | manipulator motion planning | Manipulators | Planning | Reinforcement learning | reinforcement learning | Task analysis | Training,0,0,,,,undefined,

However, to fully supplement human effort, these robots will need low-latency, reliable connectivity throughout the work zone through links established by wireless access points (APs). This will allow the robot to assuredly respond to programming directives that rely on the real-time relaying of robot-generated sensor data to the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server. In this paper, we propose L-NORM, a multi-AP and multi-robot coordination framework, as a multi-tiered solution for such autonomous edge networks. First, multi-robot motion planning through reinforcement learning occurs at the MEC, using as input multi-modal robot sensor data. Second, multi-AP resource orchestration is performed using another reinforcement learning-based method that maps a subset of available APs to each robot toward meeting their sensor data delivery requirements. Furthermore, we suggest diversity combination of uplink channels with the 802.11ax scheduled access mode that will (i) support high reliability of multi-robot uplink sensor packets and (ii) enable multi-AP coordination, for optimized resource utilization. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that the probability of robot deviation to remain within 0.5&#x00A0;m from its optimal path, is 19&#x0025; more in L-NORM compared to classical 802.11ax based edge network solution, considering <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\sim$</tex-math></inline-formula>1&#x00A0;MB of sensor data per robot.",Collision avoidance | Edge network | IEEE 802.11ax Standard | multi-modal data | Navigation | orchestration | reinforcement learning | Robot kinematics | robot navigation | Robot sensing systems | Robots | Uplink,0,0,,,,undefined,

Objective: We introduce the CS Interests and Beliefs Inventory (CSIBI), an instrument designed for novice secondary students to learn by designing projects (particularly with physical computing). The inventory contains subscales on beliefs on problem solving competency, fascination in design, value of CS, creative expression, and beliefs about context-specific CS abilities alongside programming mindsets and outcomes. We explain the creation of the instrument and attend to the role of mindsets as mediators of self-beliefs and how CSIBI may be adapted to other K-12 project-based learning settings. Method: We administered the instrument to 303 novice CS secondary students who largely came from historically marginalized backgrounds (gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status). We assessed the nine-factor structure for the 32-item instrument using confirmatory factor analysis and tested the hypothesized model of mindsets as mediators with structural equation modeling. Findings: We confirmed the nine-factor structure of CSIBI and found significant positive correlations across factors. The structural model results showed that problem solving competency beliefs and CS creative expression promoted programming growth mindset, which subsequently fostered students’ programming self-concept. Implications: We validated an instrument to measure secondary students’ self-beliefs in CS that fills several gaps in K-12 CS measurement tools by focusing on contexts of learning by designing.

RStudio, an integrated development environment, allows combining R with Markdown to RMarkdown. RStudio and RMarkdown make it easy to create dynamic documents with different output files for presentations and reports (e.g., HTML5, PDF and MS Word with limitation). It combines the core syntax of Markdown with embedded R code chunks that are run so their output (such as figures, numbers) can be included in the final document. Every run incorporates all changes to R code and text. Therefore, the final document covers all changes and updates to figures and numbers in the document. Finally, Shiny, an R package, is an extension of R to build interactive web apps and embed them into HTML slide presentations without requiring HTML, CSS, or JavaScript knowledge. It is possible to integrate Shiny code into RMarkdown to create an interactive document file that contains Shiny widgets and outputs.

This article presents a tutorial on how to build a soft-robot model using an open source finite element analysis (FEA) simulator, called SOFA. This software is able to generate a simulation scene from a code written in Python or XML, so it can be used by people with different fields of competence, like mechanical knowledge, knowledge of material properties, and programming skills.

The basic working principles of SOFA required to make a scene are explained step by step. In particular, this article shows how to simulate the mechanics and animate the bending behavior of the actuator and the importance of knowledge of the constitutive material properties for good modeling of the mechanical system. Furthermore, we will also show how to retrieve and save data from simulation, demonstrating that SOFA can easily adapt to a multidisciplinary subject, such as research in soft robotics, but can also be useful for teaching simulation and programming language principles to engineering students.",Actuators | Animation | Load modeling | Mathematical models | Python | Robots | Soft robotics,1,0,,,,undefined,

Due to the variation in models and service procedures, numerous lithium-ion battery brands, models, and retirement states exist. This uncertainty contributes to the complexity of the disassembly procedure, which calls for a great deal of adaptability. Human–Robot Collaboration Disassembly (HRCD) mode maximizes the advantages of both humans and robots, progressively replacing single-person disassembly and single-machine disassembly to become the standard method for disassembling end-of-life lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the HRCD process has more dimensions and uncertainties. In light of the obstacles above, this paper developed an HRCD environment with virtual and real interaction functions, which recommended real-time cooperation strategies in the dynamic production process and significantly enhanced the flexibility of disassembly operations. Based on the genetic algorithm (GA), the Disassembly Sequence Planning (DSP) is developed for waste LIBs in the source domain and imported into the knowledge base. Then, the rapid adaptive generation of HRCD task strategy for LIBs is generated, utilizing the transfer learning approach in the target domain. Two types of end-of-life automobile LIBs are analyzed as case study products. The results demonstrated that the proposed method could plan an effective action sequence, effectively reduce the design time of the target domain disassembly strategy, and enhance the flexibility of HRCD.",Digital twin | Disassembly sequence planning | Human–robot collaboration | Transfer learning,0,0,,,DHU,CUSF-DH-D-2022072,Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai

Such underwater cleaning has many difficulties in cleaning works. Desilting robots are widely used in sludge cleaning to reduce labor. However, since this method is usually planned based on manual experience, the operation is inefficient, not intelligent, and requires a certain amount of labor. To enable the desilting robot to intelligently plan rational cleaning paths, it uses the complete coverage path planning (CCPP) algorithm. Existing CCPP cannot meet the requirements of various environments. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to use the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to learn the sewer sedimentation tank environment and to find the optimal cleaning path. Experiments show that 2000 episodes are trained in a simplified simulation environment using deep Q network (DQN) and double DQN (DDQN), respectively. DQN only got a cumulative reward of 1000 in the 1228th episode, while DDQN got a cumulative reward of 8000 in the 343rd episode and completed the task.

In this article, we present Real-time planning using Linear Spatial Separations, or RLSS: a real-time decentralized trajectory planning algorithm for cooperative multi-robot teams in static environments. The algorithm requires relatively few robot capabilities, namely sensing the positions of robots and obstacles without higher-order derivatives and the ability of distinguishing robots from obstacles. There is no communication requirement and the robots’ dynamic limits are taken into account. RLSS generates and solves convex quadratic optimization problems that are kinematically feasible and guarantees collision avoidance if the resulting problems are feasible. We demonstrate the algorithm’s performance in real-time in simulations and on physical robots. We compare RLSS to two state-of-the-art planners and show empirically that RLSS does avoid deadlocks and collisions in forest-like and maze-like environments, significantly improving prior work, which result in collisions and deadlocks in such environments.",Collision avoidance | Decentralized robot systems | Multi-robot systems | Trajectory planning for multiple mobile robots,0,1,repositoryam,Green,NSF,CPS-1837779,National Science Foundation

To address this challenge, this article proposes a real-time, hybrid neuromorphic framework for object tracking and classification using event-based cameras that possess desirable properties such as low-power consumption (5&#x2013;14 mW) and high dynamic range (120 dB). Nonetheless, unlike traditional approaches of using event-by-event processing, this work uses a mixed frame and event approach to get energy savings with high performance. Using a frame-based region proposal method based on the density of foreground events, a hardware-friendly object tracking scheme is implemented using the apparent object velocity while tackling occlusion scenarios. The frame-based object track input is converted back to spikes for TrueNorth (TN) classification via the energy-efficient deep network (EEDN) pipeline. Using originally collected datasets, we train the TN model on the hardware track outputs, instead of using ground truth object locations as commonly done, and demonstrate the ability of our system to handle practical surveillance scenarios. As an alternative tracker paradigm, we also propose a continuous-time tracker with C<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$++$</tex-math> </inline-formula> implementation where each event is processed individually, which better exploits the low latency and asynchronous nature of neuromorphic vision sensors. Subsequently, we extensively compare the proposed methodologies to state-of-the-art event-based and frame-based methods for object tracking and classification, and demonstrate the use case of our neuromorphic approach for real-time and embedded applications without sacrificing performance. Finally, we also showcase the efficacy of the proposed neuromorphic system to a standard RGB camera setup when simultaneously evaluated over several hours of traffic recordings.",Cameras | Event-based vision | Field programmable gate arrays | FPGA implementation | IBM TrueNorth (TN) | neuromorphic vision | Neuromorphics | object classification | Object tracking | object tracking | Proposals | Real-time systems | Vision sensors,1,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Conventional path planning techniques ignore turnabout points and directions determined by environmental data, which might result in collisions or deadlocks on a narrow road. The proposed method uses the Deep Q-network (DQN) to obtain a control strategy for path planning on narrow roads. In the simulation, the robot learned the optimal velocity commands that maximized the long-term reward. The reward is designed to reach a target with a smaller change in robot velocity and fewer turnabouts. The success rate and the number of turnabouts in the simulation and experiment were used to evaluate the trained model. According to simulation and environmental data, the proposed strategy enables the robot to travel on narrow roads.

In recent years, there have been several attempts to develop soft wearable devices for supporting human-robot interfaces. Many algorithms and programming languages are available to integrate a wearable device with a soft robot. One such promising algorithm is reservoir computing (RC), which includes of a group of recurrently and randomly connected nodes. The RC model can easily process multidimensional signal data and can handle nonlineardata and has been extensively used in robotic control. It has been reported that the RC algorithm can speed up network training and solve complex data sets. However, the main existing limitations in hand-locomotion classification are the considerable run-time and the delayed response. In this study, we figure out the best machine learning algorithms to handle three-dimensional hand-gesture data. We employ a two-part strategy: a loopback filter is included in the preprocessing of the initial dataset to support the 3-dimensional (3D) signs of each hand posture; subsequently, the training dataset is applied to the machine learning algorithm which includes an artificial neural network (ANN), convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory(LSTM), and reservoir computing(RC). Each training network is optimized with various hyperparameters. Furthermore, we compare the performance of several machine-learning algorithms in classifying the three-dimensional hand-signal posture data. The results show that the classification of nonlinear hand-locomotion signals by RC requires a comparatively shorter training duration (12 minutes for training times), and that optimal accuracy 94.17, precision 94.10, and recall 93.99 is realized for time series data.",and nonlinear data | Human - machine interface | human hand-locomotion signal | multi dimension | reservoir computing | time series,1,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,KAKEN,18H05473,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science

In our model-based reinforcement learning using the skill library, the behavior of the robot is represented as a graph of skills, and the dynamics of each skill are modeled for motion planning. This method has the advantage that the learned dynamics model can be reused in other tasks and situations, and we believe that this will be the basis for a general-purpose robot motion planning method. In model-based reinforcement learning using the skill library, the introduction of tools into the existing skill library has not been considered. Adding tool-use skills into the skill library, we think resolvable situations will expand more than ever. For example, if we introduce a funnel into the liquid pouring task, we can change the dynamics of the liquid flow to make it less spillage. On the other hand, from the viewpoint of dynamics model design, modeling the flow dynamics in a way that is not affected by the use of funnels is preferable in terms of reusability. In this study, we introduce Squeeze skill (squeeze out with a soft container) and Mount Funnel skill (enlarge the receiving mouth with a funnel) into the liquid pouring task as a case study of motion planning using model-based reinforcement learning using the skill library introduced tool skills. We design dynamics models that do not depend on the addition of tools and show that the robot acquires motions that appropriately use tools according to the situation.

We have thus far proposed motion planners based on deep neural networks, DNNs, for a robot equipped with a 2D LiDAR. A multilayer perceptron, MLP, was used as the DNN. In this paper, convolutional neural network, CNN, is also used as the DNN. Policies of these so-called end-to-end motion planners represented by MLP and CNN are trained through imitation learning. However, imitation learning sometimes causes a problem of generalization ability of the motion planners. In consequence, it might be difficult for a robot to plan suitable motions in unknown environments. For this challenge, we introduce an auxiliary task into the output layer in addition to the main task to determine the linear and angular velocities as the motion output. As the auxiliary task, the motion planners estimate the destination angle. Through multi-task learning, the accuracy of the main task is increased by the auxiliary task. In the navigation experiments, we show that MLP is more effective than CNN for improving the generalization ability of the motion planners.

As an integral part of ground mobile robot research, the path planning problem has greater research and application value. Based on machine learning, the mobile robot is continuously tried and trained in the simulation environment to eventually achieve the optimal path planning requirements for real-time obstacle avoidance, resulting in a new path planning algorithm. To make the planning goal smoother, after optimizing the global path planning A_star algorithm, it is necessary to combine the Q-learning algorithm, so this paper proposes the HA-Q algorithm. Under the HA-Q algorithm, the mobile robot can smoothly move from the specified starting point to the target point where the specified function is designated, to realize the functions of obstacle avoidance and path selection. After some simulation experiments, the HA-Q algorithm is more consistent with the ground mobile robot movement in the actual scene compared to the traditional algorithm. At the same time, these experimental results also show that the algorithm can be used to obtain a short and smooth path, avoid obstacles in real time, and effectively avoid the problem of falling into a locally optimal solution.",A_star | Mobile robot | Path planning | Q-learning,0,0,,,,2021H010203,

However, the current mainstream robot navigation algorithms only treat pedestrians as dynamic obstacles and passively avoid pedestrians in local planning. When encountering fast-moving pedestrians, local path planning often fails, causing the robot to stagnate, spin or shake in place, which in turn reduces the navigation efficiency and results in unnatural navigation trajectories. To address this problem, it is desirable for the robot to find a safe and convenient temporary target to avoid the collision with fast-moving pedestrians. In this paper, we propose an obstacle avoidance learning method with the temporary target for the robot motion planning in the human-robot integration environment. The temporary target distribution is learned from imitations by using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) framework, whereby the dynamic scenario information including pedestrian information, the environmental information, and the robot information are considered as the generation conditions. With the proposed method, the mobile robot first navigates to the temporary target area, and then plans the path toward the final target point. Experimental studies reveal that the proposed method can achieve satisfactory performance with respect to different scenario conditions.",Collision avoidance | Conditional Variational Autoencoder | Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance | Human-Robot Integration Environment | Navigation | Planning | Predictive models | Robot motion | Robots | Trajectory,0,0,,,,undefined,

With the traditional method of “on-screen” program editing, these difficulties can be avoided by blocking the child's actions that lead to syntactic violations. Today, the technique of compiling programs from material objects (tangible objects) with command icons printed on them is gaining popularity. When using this technique, no blocking of erroneous user actions is possible. In this situation, the authors propose to protect the child from syntactical errors by postulating the two-dimensionality of the program and defining the syntax and semantics of the pictogrammic programming language for beginners using indentation so that any placement of pictograms in the cells of a two-dimensional table gives a syntactically correct and executable program.

There are various methods and algorithms for navigation whose initial step would be to gain knowledge of the environment that the robot is presented to. Generally, robotic path planning can be either local or global. The basic difference is that in global path planning, the robot will have clear knowledge of the environment in the form of a map; i.e. the obstacles would be known and the environment will be static, whereas in local path planning, the environment and its obstacles are dynamic. So in a local path planning method, the robot has to learn through the environment to reach a target without colliding with its obstacles. Learning happens constantly by capturing the environment as a map image. This learning process is done using deep learning that aims to learn representations of data using a neural network with several nodes. The representations are learnt by feature identification and processing in a series of stages. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to identify both the obstacle and free-space in the given environment image. Further, after such classification, an optimal path towards the goal using three sampling-based path planning algorithms is done.

In this work, a novel backend for the Open Neural Network Compiler (ONNC) is proposed, which exploits machine learning to optimize code for the ARM Cortex-M device. The backend requires minimal changes to Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) models. Several novel optimization techniques are also incorporated in the backend, such as quantizing the ONNX model's weight and automatically tuning the dimensions of operators in computations. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated for two applications: handwritten digit recognition on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset and model, and image classification on the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research and 10 (CIFAR-10) dataset with the AlexNet-Light model. The system achieves 98.90% and 90.55% accuracy for handwritten digit recognition and image classification, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed architecture is significantly more lightweight than other state-of-theart models in terms of both computation time and generated source code complexity.

The keys to solving the problem are accurately recognizing the topological model describing the entwined state of DLO(s) and a manipulation strategy based on it. The situation becomes more challenging in practical applications since the DLO(s) may be placed under complex and unencountered environments, making distinguishing between the targets and the background difficult. In addition, with the information obtained from a sensor system with a limited field of sense, a robot has to treat the encountered DLO(s) as multiple ones of an unknown quantity. This paper proposes a solution based on deep learning techniques for these complicated scenarios. The approach can derive a topological model describing the entangled structure of single or multiple DLOs. Based on the model, we proposed a strategy for untangling the DLO(s), considering both the possible self-tangling in one DLO and the tangling between multiple DLOs. The strategy ensures that the entangled DLO(s) can be arranged to be the neatest state given a limited field of view. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution were verified by untangling experiments utilizing a dual-arm robot system. Even if the exact quantity of the DLO(s) is unknown, the robots can still untangle the DLO(s).

Potential applications for the proposed method include pipeline bin-picking tasks, rope-like object manipulation in household robots, and cable assembly in industrial areas. Moreover, the topological state recognition process can also be utilized in knot-tying studies and producing datasets. As the current system can not deal with scenes where DLO segments or crossings severely overlap, practitioners should integrate real-time tracking, deformation control method, and unqualified cases detection to avoid the appearance of such cases during manipulation.

Existing methods still face the problem that detection efficiency and accuracy cannot be achieved at the same time. In this paper, we introduce artificial intelligence technology into the control system. Based on the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) algorithm, we generated a dataset and trained a deep neural network (DLNet) to improve the detection efficiency. By combining DLNet and the GJK algorithm, we propose a two-level self-collision detection algorithm (DLGJK algorithm) to solve real-time self-collision detection problems in a dual-manipulator system with fast-continuous and high-precision properties. First, the proposed algorithm uses DLNet to determine whether the current working state of the system has a risk of self-collision; since most of the working states in a system workspace do not have a self-collision risk, DLNet can effectively reduce the number of unnecessary detections and improve the detection efficiency. Then, for the working states with a risk of self-collision, we modeled precise colliders and applied the GJK algorithm for fine self-collision detection, which achieved detection accuracy. The experimental results showed that compared to that with the global use of the GJK algorithm for self-collision detection, the DLGJK algorithm can reduce the time expectation of a single detection in a system workspace by 97.7%. In the path planning of the manipulators, it could effectively reduce the number of unnecessary detections, improve the detection efficiency, and reduce system overhead. The proposed algorithm also has good scalability for a multi-manipulator system that can be split into dual-manipulator systems.",artificial intelligence | deep neural network | dual-manipulator system | GJK algorithm | self-collision detection,2,1,repositoryvor,Green,DUT,XM01006,Dalian University of Technology

Hyperspectral cameras are imaging systems that can capture a wide range of electromagnetic spectra. This feature allows them to detect a broader range of colors and features than traditional cameras and to perceive the environment more accurately. Several surface types, such as mud, can be challenging to detect using an RGB camera. In our system, the hyperspectral camera is used for ground recognition (e.g., grass, bumpy road, asphalt). Traditional global path planning methods take the shortest path length as the optimization objective. We propose an improved A* algorithm to generate the collision-free path. Semantic information makes it possible to plan a feasible and safe path in a complex off-road environment, taking traveling time as the optimization objective. We presented the results of the experiments for data collected in a natural environment. An important novelty of this paper is using a modified nearest neighbor method for hyperspectral data analysis and then using the data for path planning tasks in the same work. Using the nearest neighbor method allows us to adjust the robotic system much faster than using neural networks. As our system is continuously evolving, we intend to examine the performance of the vehicle on various road surfaces, which is why we sought to create a classification system that does not require a prolonged learning process. In our paper, we aimed to demonstrate that the incorporation of a hyperspectral camera can not only enhance route planning but also aid in the determination of parameters such as speed and acceleration.",data fusion | hyperspectral camera | mapping | path planning,1,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

Due to the continuous efforts of the scientific community, various algorithmic families emerged that have different strengths and weaknesses. Finding a suitable motion planning program is often not trivial for real-world problems, as various domain-specific factors must be considered. An obvious example is a potential trade-off between path length, computation time, and resource constraints. We propose a technique to systematically explore the space of suitable programs, aiming to find Pareto optimal algorithm configurations. Our approach makes use of Combinatory Logic Synthesis to perform component-based software composition. Software components are injected with domain-knowledge, effectively restricting the solution space of synthesizable programs. We synthesize sample-based global planning programs that make use of the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) and evaluate the produced programs to yield numeric result vectors. These steps are encapsulated in a black-box function which is used with a multi-objective optimization tool (Hypermapper) to yield an automatic, learning-based search procedure for a given feature space. We validate our approach with a series of experiments that demonstrate the extensibility and transferability of our methodology regarding different robotic systems and planning instances.",,0,0,,,,undefined,

We show that RL-based control of the accelerations of a centroidal model is surprisingly effective, when combined with a quadratic program to realize the commanded actions via ground contact forces. It allows for a simple reward structure, reduced computational costs, and robust sim-to-real transfer.

To leverage the full potential of multi-modal sensor suites, radar sensors are essential for safety critical tasks and are already installed in most new vehicles today. In this letter, we address the problem of semantic segmentation of moving objects in radar point clouds to enhance the perception of the environment with another sensor modality. Instead of aggregating multiple scans to densify the point clouds, we propose a novel approach based on the self-attention mechanism to accurately perform sparse, single-scan segmentation. Our approach, called Gaussian Radar Transformer, includes the newly introduced Gaussian transformer layer, which replaces the softmax normalization by a Gaussian function to decouple the contribution of individual points. To tackle the challenge of the transformer to capture long-range dependencies, we propose our attentive up- and downsampling modules to enlarge the receptive field and capture strong spatial relations.

The IRAP2 framework is based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm because the path planning is a typical continuous control problem in a dynamic environment, and DDPG is well suited for such problems. To test the IRAP2 framework, we have studied a HRC workspace in which the robot size is larger than humans. At first, we have applied a physics engine to build a virtual HRC workspace including digital models of a robot and a human. Using this virtual HRC workspace as the environment model, we further trained an agent model using the DDPG algorithm.

In particular, policies learned using reinforcement learning often fail to generalize to novel environments due to unsafe behavior. In this paper, we propose Sim-to-Lab-to-Real to bridge the reality gap with a probabilistically guaranteed safety-aware policy distribution. To improve safety, we apply a dual policy setup where a performance policy is trained using the cumulative task reward and a backup (safety) policy is trained by solving the Safety Bellman Equation based on Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis. In Sim-to-Lab transfer, we apply a supervisory control scheme to shield unsafe actions during exploration; in Lab-to-Real transfer, we leverage the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-Bayes framework to provide lower bounds on the expected performance and safety of policies in unseen environments. Additionally, inheriting from the HJ reachability analysis, the bound accounts for the expectation over the worst-case safety in each environment. We empirically study the proposed framework for ego-vision navigation in two types of indoor environments with varying degrees of photorealism.

However, path planning and navigation obstacle avoidance among multiple robots, as well as dynamic environments, raise significant challenges. We propose a distributed multi-mobile robot navigation and obstacle avoidance method in unknown environments. First, we propose a bidirectional alternating jump point search A* algorithm (BAJPSA*) to obtain the robot’s global path in the prior environment and further improve the heuristic function to enhance efficiency. We construct a robot kinematic model based on the dynamic window approach (DWA), present an adaptive navigation strategy, and introduce a new path tracking evaluation function that improves path tracking accuracy and optimality. To strengthen the security of obstacle avoidance, we modify the decision rules and obstacle avoidance rules of the single robot and further improve the decision avoidance capability of multi-robot systems. Moreover, the mainstream prioritization method is used to coordinate the local dynamic path planning of our multi-robot systems to resolve collision conflicts, reducing the difficulty of obstacle avoidance and simplifying the algorithm.

The Navier-Stokes equations describe fluid flows and are representative of nonlinear physical systems with complex spatio-temporal interactions. Fluid flows are omnipresent in nature and engineering applications, and their accurate simulation is essential for providing insights into these processes. While PDEs are typically solved with numerical methods, the recent success of machine learning (ML) has shown that ML methods can provide novel avenues of finding solutions to PDEs. ML is becoming more and more present in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). However, up to this date, there does not exist a general-purpose ML-CFD package which provides 1) powerful state-of-the-art numerical methods, 2) seamless hybridization of ML with CFD, and 3) automatic differentiation (AD) capabilities. AD in particular is essential to ML-CFD research as it provides gradient information and enables optimization of preexisting and novel CFD models. In this work, we propose JAX-Fluids: a comprehensive fully-differentiable CFD Python solver for compressible two-phase flows. JAX-Fluids is intended for ML-supported CFD research. The framework allows the simulation of complex fluid dynamics with phenomena like three-dimensional turbulence, compressibility effects, and two-phase flows. Written entirely in JAX, it is straightforward to include existing ML models into the proposed framework. Furthermore, JAX-Fluids enables end-to-end optimization. I.e., ML models can be optimized with gradients that are backpropagated through the entire CFD algorithm, and therefore contain not only information of the underlying PDE but also of the applied numerical methods. We believe that a Python package like JAX-Fluids is crucial to facilitate research at the intersection of ML and CFD and may pave the way for an era of differentiable fluid dynamics.

Nature of problem: The compressible Navier-Stokes equations describe continuum-scale fluid flows. These flows often involve highly complex flow phenomena such as shocks, material interfaces, and turbulence. The intrinsic nonlinear dynamics render the numerical simulation of the these equations challenging. Machine learning provides novel avenues for describing partial differential equations. Machine learning models rely on gradient information provided by automatic differentiation and are often implemented in Python. In contrast, existing high-performance computational fluid dynamics codes are typically written in Fortran or C++ and do not offer inherent automatic differentiation capabilities. These discrepancies hinder the advance of machine-learning-supported computational fluid dynamics. Up to this day, a general-purpose fully-differentiable computational fluid dynamics solver for compressible two-phase flows is missing. Solution method: We introduce JAX-Fluids: a general-purpose three-dimensional fully-differentiable computational fluid dynamics solver for compressible two-phase flows. JAX-Fluids is a simulation framework intended for machine-learning-supported computational fluid dynamics research. Our framework is written entirely in JAX, a high-performance numerical computing library with automatic differentiation capabilities. We have used an object-oriented programming style and a modular design philosophy. This allows the straightforward exchange of numerical methods. We provide a wide variety of state-of-the-art high-order computational methods for compressible flows. The modularity of our framework additionally facilitates the integration of custom subroutines. We use the sharp-interface level-set method to model two-phase flows. The software package can easily be installed as a Python package. We have build the source code around the JAX NumPy API. This makes JAX-Fluids accessible and performant. JAX-Fluids runs on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. We use HDF5 in combination with XDMF for writing output quantities. The Python packages Haiku and Optax are used for implementation and training of machine learning methods. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: JAX-Fluids relies on open-source third-party Python libraries. These are automatically installed. In the current version, JAX-Fluids only runs on a single accelerator (CPU/GPU/TPU). Future versions will include support for parallel execution. JAX-Fluids has been tested on Linux and macOS operating systems.",Computational fluid dynamics | Differential programming | Level-set | Machine learning | Navier-Stokes equations | Turbulence | Two-phase flows,7,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Reasons, for example, are the lack of programming and automation solutions with which simple tasks can be easily and in no time teached onto a robotic application. One of the fastest possibilities of online-teaching robots without programming is hand-guiding. Provided mainly for human robot collaboration most of the suitable cobots have a restricted payload. This leads to a very limited field of application regarding machining or the handling of heavy weight tools. In contrast high-load industrial robots are very common for large-series machining, but the necessary knowledge and programming effort currently prevent the use for quickly changing tasks. This paper presents an approach, which reduces the time for online teaching of industrial robot machining. An equipped hand guidance and additional force sensors enable the user to perform the machining operation by handling the workpiece or tool as usual and records the resulting process paths and forces for teaching. Combined with a simple graphical interface for the necessary user-input the solution is empowered to repeat the recorded machining operation according to the current setup autonomously. With a target-actual comparison of the resulting forces the automatic process can be monitored. With this holistic approach the solution is suitable either for handling tasks, common machining and part-to-tool machining on external tools.",Hand guidance | Human robot collaboration | Joining | Online teaching | Robot machining | Woodworking,0,0,,,,undefined,

Considering that the existing studies failed to capture the dynamic changes in the production environment, a novel dynamic scheduling framework is proposed that seamingly integrates expert knowledge with a dynamic programming process. Given the phase characteristics of the steelmaking processes, data series are first partitioned into information granules based on the production plan to form the knowledge-based initial policies. To achieve dynamic scheduling process, a two-stage value function approximation method is proposed, where in the first stage one learns an event-driven Q-function by the fuzzy rule-based states, and then an action fitting strategy is developed for evaluating continuous actions. Considering the difficulties of establishing a mechanism-based model, the state transition process is described by a granular prediction model to simulate taking actions. On their basis, a dynamic compensation for the initial policies is finally achieved. A number of comparative experiments are conducted by utilizing the practical data coming from a steel plant. The results show that the proposed method can deliver effective solutions for long-term scheduling scenarios. Note to Practitioners - Given that the steelmaking process is a discontinuous one and the byproduct gas system can hardly be described by a physical or mechanism-based model, its energy scheduling works is usually performed by manual approach or using static optimization methods, which would lead to low accuracy and a waste of energy. Since a large number of real-time data had been accumulated by the SCADA system implemented in most steel plants, a data-driven dynamic scheduling approach is proposed in this study. The proposed method takes advantages of the expert knowledge and production plan data, and produces dynamic scheduling solutions by utilizing an actor-critic learning process. The application system on the basis of the proposed method can adapt to different scenarios and ensure long-term safety operations of the gas tanks. Furthermore, since there may be missing data or outliners in the acquired data collected by the SCADA onsite, it is necessary to perform data imputation and filtering methods to guarantee the data integrity and reliability. This study avoids the redundant introduction of such preliminary preprocessing methods for the sample data.",byproduct gas system | Energy scheduling | granular computing | reinforcement learning | steel industry,4,0,,,NSFC,2018RJ01,National Natural Science Foundation of China

We model the interaction between the agent (player 1) and the adversary (player 2) as a two-player concurrent stochastic game in which the adversary has incomplete information about the agent's task specification given as a temporal logic formula. During the interaction, the adversary can infer the agent's intention from observations and adapt its strategy so as to prevent the agent from satisfying the objective. To plan against such an adaptive opponent, the agent must leverage its knowledge about the adversary's incomplete information to influence the behavior of the opponent, and thereby be deceptive. To synthesize a deceptive strategy, we introduce a class of hypergame models that capture the interaction between the agent and its adversary given asymmetric, incomplete information. We develop a solution concept for this class of hypergames and show that the subjectively rationalizable strategy for the agent is deceptive and maximizes the probability of satisfying the task in temporal logic. Such a deceptive strategy is obtained by modeling the opponent's evolving perception of the agent's objective and integrating it into planning. This allows the agent to manipulate the opponent's perception so as to induce the opponent into taking actions that benefit the agent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our deceptive planning algorithm using robot motion planning examples with temporal logic objectives and design a detection mechanism to notify the agent of potential errors in modeling the adversary's behavior. Note to Practitioners - Many security and defense applications employ deception mechanisms for strategic advantages. This work presents a game-theoretic framework for planning deceptive strategies in stochastic environments and shows that the opponent modeling plays a key role in the design of effective deception mechanisms.

The core of the proposed method is based on a novel neural network model, i.e., graph wasserstein autoencoder (GraphWAE) network, which is used to represent the implicit sampling distributions of the configuration space (C-space) for sampling-based planning algorithms. Through learning the implicit distributions, we can guide the planning process to search or extend in the desired region to reduce the collision checks dramatically for fast and high-quality motion planning. The theoretical analysis and proofs are given to demonstrate the probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality of the proposed method. Numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through a series of planning problems from 2D, 6D and 12D robot C-spaces in the challenging scenes. Results indicate that the proposed method can achieve better planning performance than the state-of-the-art planning algorithms. Note to Practitioners - The motivation of this work is to develop a fast and high-quality asymptotically optimal motion planning method for practical applications such as autonomous driving, robotic manipulation and others. Due to the time consumption caused by collision detection, current planning algorithms usually take much time to converge to the optimal motion path especially in the complicated environment. In this paper, we present a neural network model based on GraphWAE to learn the biasing sampling distributions as the sample generation source to further reduce or avoid collision checks of sampling-based planning algorithms. The proposed method is general and can be also deployed in other sampling-based planning algorithms for improving planning performance in different robot applications.",collision detection | graph wasserstein autoencoder | kinematic constraints | Motion planning | robotic manipulation,0,0,repositoryam,Green,NSFC,WD2C20205500306,Foundation of Equipment Pre-research Area
