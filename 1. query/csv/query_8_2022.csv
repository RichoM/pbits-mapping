Diversity and inclusion are important topics, however, insights on suited programming materials for younger learners with visual impairments are lacking. A wide range of programming materials for children exists, diverse in both what is being programmed (output) and how this is done (input), yet often relying on visual features. An understanding of the usability and accessibility aspects of these different materials is important to inform educational practice and to increase understanding of what makes programming materials suited for low vision and blind children. The aim of this study is to explore the usability and accessibility of programming materials currently used in education to low vision and blind children in the Netherlands. A focus group was conducted with six teachers or IT experts, all working with the target group in special education. The thematic analysis of the discussion of 25 materials (including unplugged lessons, robots and robotic kits, block-based and text-based languages) showed the potential of several materials, especially unplugged lessons, and the continuing search for suited materials and workforms specifically for the blind children. Furthermore, prioritizing ""fun""and close connections to children's daily life as well as careful explorations of usability at the cognitive level came forward as important factors for future research and development in programming materials for low vision and blind children.

In power, performance, and area (PPA) estimation of embedded memories, every new memory compiler version is considered independently of previous compiler versions. Since the data of different memory compilers originate from similar domains, transfer learning may reduce the amount of supervised data required by pre-training PPA estimation neural networks on related domains. We show that provisioning times of PPA models for new compiler versions can be reduced significantly by exploiting similarities among different compilers, versions, and technology nodes. Through transfer learning, we shorten the time to provision PPA models for new compiler versions, which speeds up time-critical periods of the design cycle. Using only 901 training samples (10%) is sufficient to achieve an almost worst-case (98th percentile) estimation error of 2.67% and allows us to shorten model provisioning times from 40 days to less than one week without sacrificing accuracy. To enable a diverse set of source domains for transfer learning, we devise a new, application-independent method for overcoming structural domain differences through domain equalization that attains competitive results when compared to domain-free transfer. A high degree of automation necessitates the efficient assessment of the best source domains. We propose using various metrics to accurately identify four of the five best among 45 datasets with low computational effort.",artificial neural networks | deep learning | Electronic design automation | few-shot learning | machine learning | memory compilers | regression | transfer learning,0,0,,,,undefined,

The first agent is trained to deal with the path following task and the other agent is trained to handle the point following task. The agent of the point following task is utilized to control the group of robots to move with a specific formation.

First, it is modeled mathematically through the Markov decision-making process, and a new ball-passing strategy solution based on a deep neural network is proposed. In addition, this paper also tries to use the traditional single-layer neural network to solve the same problem and compares the accuracy difference and model performance of the two types of neural networks. Finally, the possibility of applying a deep learning network in MAS is analyzed. The results show that the deep neural network has high effectiveness in solving the problem of the passing strategy of RoboCup. The ball control rate in the simulation environment is far more than the traditional algorithm, and the model trained by the deep learning network is significantly higher than the traditional neural network in accuracy, efficiency, and other aspects.

However, current industrial robots are still largely preprogrammed with very little autonomy and still required to be reprogramed by robotics experts for even slightly changed tasks. Therefore, it is highly desirable that robots can adapt to certain task changes with motion planning strategies to easily work with non-robotic experts in manufacturing environments. In this paper, we propose a user-guided motion planning algorithm in combination with reinforcement learning (RL) method to enable robots automatically generate their motion plans for new tasks by learning from a few kinesthetic human demonstrations. Features of common human demonstrated tasks in a specific application environment, e.g., desk assembly or warehouse loading/unloading are abstracted and saved in a library. The definition of semantical similarity between features in the library and features of a new task is proposed and further used to construct the reward function in RL. To achieve an adaptive motion plan facing task changes or new task requirements, features embedded in the library are mapped to appropriate task segments based on the trained motion planning policy using Q-learning. A new task can be either learned as a combination of a few features in the library or a requirement for further human demonstration if the current library is insufficient for the new task. We evaluate our approach on a 6 DOF UR5e robot on multiple tasks and scenarios and show the effectiveness of our method with respect to different scenarios.",Human-robot collaboration | Learning from demonstration | Motion planning | Reinforcement learning,2,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,NSF,CMMI1853454,National Science Foundation

Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis of how to distribute place cell fields according to the obstacles in cluttered environments to optimize learning time and path optimality during goal-oriented spatial navigation tasks. The analysis uses a reinforcement learning (RL) model that assumes that place cells allow encoding the state. While previous studies have suggested exploiting different field sizes to represent areas requiring different spatial resolutions, our work analyzes specific distributions that adapt the representation to the environment, activating larger fields in open areas and smaller fields near goals and subgoals (e.g., obstacle corners).

Unfortunately, these countries lack the technological infrastructure for the design, testing, and implementation of projects in the domain. This paper presents a Very Simple Programming Kit (VSPK) for Embedded Systems suitable for practical training, project design, and testing in the domain for use in developing countries. The microcontroller-based system makes it easy to test, teach and train in various areas of embedded systems including programming, communication, signal acquisition and processing, remote control, and domotics. A VSPK prototype has been produced and is used for real-time simulation of Embedded applications. This operation involves the VSPK, the PIC programmer, the PC and the application program to be tested progressively and the displays observed on the LCD and LEDs. The debugging process is easily performed and errors are detected and corrected. The main features of VSPK are low production cost, low power consumption, flexible peripheral pin selection, integrated LCD module, and simple hardware and software environment. Unlike similar kits available for educational purposes, VSPK possesses some advantages such as an integrated graphic color LCD, a configurable internal oscillator, numerically controlled oscillators, testing LEDs, testing buttons, and complete access to multiple programming languages.

However, the traditional robot path planner has a slow planning response, which leads to a long navigation completion time. In this paper, we propose a novel robot path planner (SOA+A2C) that produces global and local path planners with the seeker optimization algorithm (SOA) and the advantage actor-critic (A2C) algorithm, respectively. In addition, to solve the problems of poor convergence performance when training deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in complex path planning tasks and path redundancy when metaheuristic algorithms, such as SOA, are used for path planning, we propose the incremental map training method and path de-redundancy method. Simulation results show that first, the incremental map training method can improve the convergence performance of the DRL agent in complex path planning tasks. Second, the path de-redundancy method can effectively alleviate path redundancy without sacrificing the search capability of the metaheuristic algorithm. Third, the SOA+A2C path planner is superior to the Dijkstra & dynamic window approach (Dijkstra+DWA) and the Dijkstra & timed elastic band (Dijkstra+TEB) path planners provided by the robot operating system (ROS) in terms of path length, path planning response time, and navigation completion time.

In this paper, an improved path planning algorithm is proposed to increase the autonomous level of spine surgery robots for higher safety and accuracy. Firstly, the dynamic gravitational constant and piecewise repulsion function are adopted to improve the traditional Artificial Potential Field algorithm to solve the common issues of path planning, including local minimum, unable to reach the target near obstacles. To better control the pose of the end-effector in an operation space, the positions of the two endpoints of the end-effector are further constrained. Secondly, an improved Primal-Dual Neural Network with multiple constraints is proposed to minimize the joint angular velocity norm. The multiple constraints are formulated according to the planned path, the obstacle avoidance of the robot and the joint limits. Moreover, a real-time planned velocity scheme is applied to prevent the accumulation of position errors. The simulation results of the pedicle screw implantation demonstrate that the robot can find the collision-free trajectory and arrive at the target position in various complicated situations. More specifically, the error between two endpoints of the end-effector and the target pose is below 0.1 mm in reaching the surgical tool pose, while the maximum position error is around 0.05 mm when performing the planned path. Moreover, two experiments are conducted in the real-world to verify the proposed algorithm is effective in practice.",Artificial potential field | Path planning | Primal-dual neural network | Surgical robot,0,0,,,NSFC,61272255,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Computers embedded in artificial intelligent systems can execute arbitrary inference algorithms capable of outperforming humans at specific tasks. However, without real-time self-programming functionality, they must be preprogrammed by humans and will likely to fail in unpredictable environments beyond their preprogrammed domains. In this work, a Si-based synaptic resistor (synstor) was developed by integrating Al2Ox/TaOy materials to emulate biological synapses. The synstors were characterized, and their operation mechanism based on the charge stored in the oxygen vacancies in the Al2Ox material was simulated and analyzed, to understand the inference, learning, and memory functions of the synstors. A self-programming neuromorphic integrated circuit (SNIC) based on synstors was fabricated to execute inference and learning algorithms concurrently in real-time with an energy efficiency more than six-orders of magnitudes higher than those of standard digital computers. The SNIC dynamically modified its algorithm in a real-time learning process to control a morphing wing, thus successfully improving its lift-to-drag force ratio and recovering the wing from stall in complex aerodynamic environments. The synaptic resistor circuits can potentially circumvent the fundamental limitations of computers, thus providing a platform analogous to neurobiological network with real-time self-programming functionality for artificial intelligent systems.",intelligent morphing wing | self-programming neuromorphic integrated circuits | Si-based synaptic resistor,1,0,,,NSF,CHE-1338173,National Science Foundation

This is owing to its simplicity and adaptability to a wide range of applications and circumstances, as opposed to specific Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerators and compilers that are often designed only for certain specific hardware (e.g., Google Coral Edge TPU). With the growing demand for quantization, ensuring the reliability of this strategy is becoming a critical challenge. Traditional testing methods, which gather more and more genuine data for better assessment, are often not practical because of the large size of the input space and the high similarity between the original DNN and its quantized counterpart. As a result, advanced assessment strategies have become of paramount importance. In this paper, we present DiverGet, a search-based testing framework for quantization assessment. DiverGet defines a space of metamorphic relations that simulate naturally-occurring distortions on the inputs. Then, it optimally explores these relations to reveal the disagreements among DNNs of different arithmetic precision. We evaluate the performance of DiverGet on state-of-the-art DNNs applied to hyperspectral remote sensing images. We chose the remote sensing DNNs as they’re being increasingly deployed at the edge (e.g., high-lift drones) in critical domains like climate change research and astronomy. Our results show that DiverGet successfully challenges the robustness of established quantization techniques against naturally-occurring shifted data, and outperforms its most recent concurrent, DiffChaser, with a success rate that is (on average) four times higher.",Deep Learning | Hyperspectral images | Metamorphic Relations | Quantization assessment | Search-Based Software Testing,2,0,repositoryam,Green,CIFAR,undefined,Canadian Institute for Advanced Research

To date, there are few works in the literature investigating the intersection between smart manufacturing and emotion recognition, and these are mainly related to improving human–machine interaction. The authors’ aim is to research for innovation in the intersection of three different fields of study such as parametric modelling, smart manufacturing and emotion recognition in order to create personalized and innovative manufacturable models. To this purpose, an application has been generated that exploits both visual scripting, typical of parametric modelling, and scripting, in the Python programming language.

However, it is a challenging task to implement a feasible embedded detection model with advanced machine learning techniques such as deep learning. It is due to the limited support provided by programming languages on the data plane and the computing resource constraints at the edge. We propose a joint traffic classification architecture called JointNIDS that splits a classification model into two sequential sub-models. In this model, the primary switch is dedicated to major attack classification. The secondary switch is used mainly for a further in-depth inspection of the rest of the minor traffic types. The presence of some partially overlapping hidden units in the two sequential switches can help to reduce the computational overhead at the edge, while increasing the packet inspection throughput. Experimental results on the P4 framework demonstrate that JointNIDS has reduced attack detection time, while achieving a similar accuracy performance, as other counterpart algorithms. To further develop the proposed architecture, JointNIDS implements an optimization step. It maximizes the amount of data to be inspected by a system, taking into account the constraints of computing resources and network bandwidth for a given performance requirement.

In particular, NMF has been successfully used to extract simplified and organized movement primitives from myoelectric signal (MES) for robust control of multi-degree of freedom humanoid robots. However, MES is typically contaminated by complex noise sources. The system performance often degrades due to the simplified Gaussian assumption of the noise distribution in existing NMF methods. Furthermore, most existing NMF models are unable to automatically determine the rank of the latent matrices. To address these issues, this article presents a hybrid variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture and NMF (GMNMF) model with a finite Gaussian mixture model adopted to fit the mixed noise density function of MES. In addition, the automatic relevant determination criterion is applied to automatically infer the number of movement primitives. The coordinate descent update rules for the proposed model are formulated by mean-field variational Bayesian inference. We assess the model performance on five synthetic noise distribution functions and an experimental MES dataset to perform six wrist movements. The results demonstrate that GMNMF yields low error and high robustness in extracting the movement primitives over four competitive methods for robust cybernetic control.",Bayesian inference | Gaussian mixture model (GMM) | humanoid robots | model learning for control | movement primitive | nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF),0,0,,,,undefined,

Instead, the geometric feature of interplane relations finds relative differences between the coordinates of the 3D model and those of the real workcell. In addition, an iterative method of estimating world coordinates is introduced to increase the accuracy of the revised robot path.

Although most of those methods are probabilistic, and their performances intensively depend on the demonstrated data, measuring and evaluating human demonstrations are rarely investigated. A poorly demonstrated data set with useless prior knowledge or redundant demonstrations increases the complexity and time cost of robot learning. To solve these problems, a goal-directed robot skill learning framework named GPm-MOGP is presented. It 1) decides when and where to add a new demonstration by calculating the trajectory uncertainty; 2) determines which demonstration is useless or redundant by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence; 3) implements robot skill learning with a minimum number of demonstrations using a multioutput Gaussian process; and 4) learns orientation uncertainty and representation by combining logarithmic and exponential maps. The proposed framework significantly reduces the demonstrated effort of nontechnical end users who lack an understanding of how and what the robot learns during the demonstrating process. To evaluate the proposed framework, a pick-and-place experiment was designed with five unseen goals to verify the effectiveness of our methods. This experiment is well illustrated with two phases: 1) demonstration efficiency and 2) skill representation and reproduction. The results indicate an improvement of 60% in human demonstration efficiency, compared to common learning from demonstrations (LfD) applications that require at least ten demonstrations, and the robot average success rate of pick-and-place task reaches 85%.",Computational efficiency | Gaussian processes | human-robot interaction | robot learning,1,0,,,,undefined,

HGG enhances HER by selecting intermediate goals that are easy to achieve in the short term and promising to lead to target goals in the long term. This guided exploration makes HGG applicable to tasks in which target goals are far away from the object's initial position. However, the vanilla HGG is not applicable to manipulation tasks with obstacles because the Euclidean metric used for HGG is not an accurate distance metric in such an environment. Although, with the guidance of a handcrafted distance grid, grid-based HGG can solve manipulation tasks with obstacles, a more feasible method that can solve such tasks automatically is still in demand.

Learning acquisition focused on the basic structure and components of a robot, principles of robot motion, hull structure, principles of sailboat navigation, and skills of designing and assembling sailboats. Learning performance referred that students were satisfied with their hands-on performances and confident of their abilities to perform better in similar disciplines, but did not learn well on programming. Learning perception indicated that students felt interested in i-STEM PjBL materials could acquire knowledge and skills from various fields, PjBL could be helpful to complete works, and principles could be helpful in practice, while programming design learning materials were not enough. Learning challenges indicated that students were unfamiliar with the usage of tools and hands-on operation, and they also felt challenged by programming. Students' feedback can be taken as references to modify and improve i-STEM PjBL and the materials in the future.",data-transformation design | educational value | mixed-methods research | project-based learning | robot,2,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

We develop a computational environment that allows to implement attacker agents under a stochastic optimization framework, allowing to use different techniques to model attacking behavior (i.e., policies), including approximate dynamic programming, reinforcement learning, or stochastic programming, as well as arbitrary policies (e.g., rules of thumb). We rely on the ADVISE formalism to represent attack paths on CPSs, leveraging their Markov Decision Process structure to build an environment that allows to test attacker and defender policies. The proposed environment is tested by simulating attacks on a SCADA system previously addressed in the literature, demonstrating satisfactory convergence for a Q-learning algorithm, which allows to identify the attack steps that most frequently lead to successful attacks. The proposed approach allows flexibility in modeling attackers, and allows to conceive models with interacting attacker and defender agents, which is left as the main goal of future work.",attacker-defender | cyber-physical systems | reinforcement learning | stochastic optimization,1,0,,,,undefined,

The N value in the EFL column was stated as 15 but should be 16. The corrected Table 2 appears below. In the published article, there was also an error in the abstract as published. The number of participants in each of the Grade 6 classes was stated as 15 but should be 16. The corrected abstract appears below. Using educational robots (ERs) to integrate computational thinking (CT) with cross-disciplinary content has gone beyond Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), to include foreign-language learning (FL) and further crosscontext target-language (TL) acquisition. Such integration must not solely emphasise CT problem-solving skills. Rather, it must provide students with interactive learning to support their target-language (TL) interaction while reducing potential TL anxiety. This study aimed to validate the effects of the proposed method of pair programming (PP) along with question-and-response interaction in a boardgame activity on young learners’ CT skills and TL learning across contexts. Two Grade 6 classes, one with 16 students who were studying Chinese as a Second Language (CSL) and the other with 16 students who were studying English as a Foreign Language (EFL), participated in the activity. A series of instruments on achievement assessment, questionnaires on CT skills and TL anxiety, and sequential Frontiers in Psychology learning behaviour analysis were used to critically examine the results. Themain conclusion is that the EFL group showed better social skills of cooperation on CT and lower TL learning anxiety, while the CSL group demonstrated better problem-solving skills in CT, but presented more behaviours of trial-and-error loops. Results not only contribute suggestions for cross-disciplinary learning but also provide support for cross-context instruction beyond educational coursework. In the published article, there was also an error in Research Method, Participants, Paragraph 1. The number of participants was wrongly stated as 30 but should be 32. Also the number of participants learning Chinese as a second language (CSL) and learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL) was stated as 15 when it should be 16. The corrected paragraph appears below: A total of 32 Grade 6 students participated in this study, 16 of whom were learning Chinese as a second language (CSL) in Singapore, while 16 were learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in Taiwan. None of the students had any previous experience of accessing interdisciplinary activities. Both groups participated in a language classroom with several weeks tailored for interdisciplinary activities. They were all volunteers to participate in the task. Both groups’ language proficiency was considered to be at an elementary level. The research team cooperated with both the CSL teachers in Singapore and the EFL teachers in Taiwan to conduct the study in each of their specific contexts. In the published article, there was also an error in Results, Learning achievement, Paragraph 1. In sentence 2, the p-value was given as “p = 0.000 > 0.05” but should be “p > 0.05.” The corrected paragraph appears below. The purpose of this study was to examine if CSL and EFL had different learning outcomes when students were taking part in the interdisciplinary activities of language and CT integration. A significant difference was observed from the t-test results of the pre-test scores of the two groups (t = −4.991, p > 0.05), meaning that the homogeneous hypothesis of the two groups’ achievements before the activity was violated. This implied that directly investigating the progress effects of dependent variables was reasonable. The result showed that no significant difference was found for language-learning progress in the independent sample t tests (t = 0.23; p = 0.812 > 0.05) between CSL (M = 10.00) and EFL (M = 9.13). However, a significant effect was observed for CT progress (t = 3.02; p = 0.005 < 0.05) and post-test progress (t = 0.81; p = 0.009 < 0.05). The CSL group had significantly higher progress performance in CT progress (M = 19.75) and post-test progress (M = 29.75) in comparison with the EFL group in CT progress (M = 5.63) and post-test progress (M = 14.75), when participating in this learning activity (Table 2). In addition, there was also an error in Results, Learning behaviours, Paragraph 1. The paragraph previously stated, “Three loops were analysed based on the analysis of Chevalier et al. (2020) of the CCPS model (Loop 1 and 2) and the loop for FL interaction (Loop 3).” But should be, “Three loops were analysed based on the analysis of Chevalier et al. (2020) of the CCPS model (Loop 1 and 3) and the loop for FL interaction (Loop 2).” The corrected paragraph appears below. In answering the fourth research question, sequential behaviour analysis was executed to examine the differences between the learning behaviours of the two groups. The behavioural sequence reaches a significant level (p < 0.05) when the Z value is more than 1.96 (Z > 1.96; Bakeman and Gottman, 1997). Figures 6, 7 present the behavioural transition diagrams of the students involved in two learning groups; the z-scores are shown on the middle line and each line’s direction represents its transfer direction. Three loops were analysed based on the analysis of Chevalier et al. (2020) of the CCPS model (Loop 1 and 3) and the loop for FL interaction (Loop 2). In addition, there was also an error in Results, Learning behaviours, Paragraph 4. This paragraph previously stated: “Otherwise, the ESL’s three significant behaviour sequences are” but it should be “Otherwise, the EFL’s three significant behaviour sequences are”. The corrected paragraph appears below: Otherwise, the EFL’s three significant behaviour sequences are: AT ! CD, PM ! ID, and LI ! PLI. When aiming to reach the intended destination they demonstrated Loops 1 and 3. The EFL students collaboratively generated ideas by working on algorithms (AT ! CD), and they physically expressed their ideas using gestures individually to justify their CT concepts to their partners (PM! ID). Such formulation fell into the essence of negotiation on problem-solving strategies, and thus the EFL students revealed their behaviours of significantly engaging in target-language interaction in Loop 2 (LI ! PLI). Following the PP task of coding and conversation practice, the EFL students frequently interacted with one another, kept concentrating on the robots’ movements, and used assigned English sentences when it was their turn. If errors occurred, the teacher would come by and guide them to use the taught sentence in their interaction (LI! PLI).

However, coding education in Thailand appears to lag behind that of many other countries due to the lack of accessible coding learning resources suitable for students as well as the limited number of teachers with coding experience. Regarding these issues, we have developed an open-source hardware-based coding platform named KidBright, based on these requirements: 1. making coding simple for novice learners through the use of graphical blocks with Thai and English support; 2. inspiring young students to develop creative embedded applications with minimal effort; and 3. providing sustainable support for coding education. KidBright is proposed as a coding learning tool that can motivate children to learn to code and develop embedded system projects using its block-based coding environment, the KidBright IDE, in conjunction with its embedded device, the KidBright board. KidBright is distinguished from other embedded programming platforms due to the deployment of a dedicated software framework as the backend of the KidBright IDE. In this article, we introduce KidBright and present the design, architecture, and demonstrations of the software framework, the key roles of which are to conceal low-level hardware issues from learners and to enable makers to develop new command blocks and hardware peripherals in support of KidBright. We claim that, with this particular design, KidBright can help support coding education sustainably.

The safe path is determined with the turning point algorithm from the moving robot's starting position to the destination position without obstacles. The efficient path for the static and dynamic environment of the safe path is determined using reinforcement learning. Evolutionary particle swarm optimization (EPSO) has been used to enhance the path planning approach for mobile robots to make this path planning robust and efficient. The proposed evolutionary-based path planning approach for mobile robots satisfies three objectives, such as safe path, efficient path length, and also suitable for static and dynamic environments.

The improved PRM algorithm mainly improves the density and distribution of sampling points in the narrow channel, through a combination of the learning process of the PRM algorithm and the APF algorithm. We also shortened the required time and path length by optimizing the query process. The first key technology to improve the PRM algorithm involves optimizing the number and distribution of free points and collision-free lines in the free workspace. To ensure full visibility of the narrow channel, we extend the obstacles through the diagonal distance of the mobile robot while ignoring the safety distance. Considering the safety distance during movement, we re-classify the all sampling points obtained by the quasi-random sampling principle into three categories: free points, obstacle points, and adjacent points. Next, we transform obstacle points into the free points of the narrow channel by combining the APF algorithm and the characteristics of the narrow channel, increasing the density of sampling points in the narrow space. Then, we include potential energy judgment into the construction process of collision-free lines shortening the required time and reduce collisions with obstacles. Optimizing the query process of the PRM algorithm is the second key technology. To reduce the required time in the query process, we adapt the bidirectional A* algorithm to query these local paths and obtain an effective path to the target point. We also combine the path pruning technology with the potential energy function to obtain a short path without collisions. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the new PRM path planning technology can improve the density of free points in narrow spaces and achieve an optimized, collision-free path in complex environments with multiple narrow channels.",artificial potential function | narrow channels | path planning | path pruning technology | probabilistic road-map algorithm,2,1,repositoryvor,Green,NKRDPC,2016YFC0803000,National Key Research and Development Program of China

Most modern robotic sensors produce some form of depth data or point cloud information that is only useful to the agent after being processed into the appropriate data structure, oftentimes an occupancy map. However, as the quality of sensor technology improves, so does the magnitude of the input data, which can creates a problem when trying to construct occupancy maps in real-time. Populating such an occupancy map using these dense point clouds can quickly become an expensive process, and many robotic agents have limited onboard computational bandwidth and memory. This results in delayed map updates and reduced operational performance in dynamic environments where real-time information is crucial for safe operation. However, while many modern robotic agents are still relatively limited by the power of onboard central processing units (CPUs), many platforms are gaining access to onboard graphics processing units (GPUs), and these resources remain underutilised with respect to the problem of occupancy mapping. We propose a novel probabilistic mapping solution that leverages a combination of OpenVDB, NanoVDB, and Nvidia’s Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) to encode dense point clouds into OpenVDB data structures, leveraging the parallel compute strength of GPUs to provide significant speed advantages and further free up resources for tasks that cannot as easily be performed in parallel. An evaluation of our solution is provided, with performance benchmarks provided for both a laptop and a low power single board computer with onboard GPU. Similar performance improvements should be accessible on any system with access to a CUDA-compatible GPU.

First, we mapped the dynamic programming method to typical optimal path planning problems for mobile robots, and created a new efficient DP-based method to find an exact, analytical, optimal solution for the path planning problem. Then, we used high-quality training data gathered using the DP method for DRL, which greatly improves training data quality and learning efficiency. Next, we established a two-stage reinforcement learning method where, prior to the DRL, we employed extreme learning machines (ELM) to initialize the parameters of actor and critic neural networks to a near-optimal solution in order to significantly improve the learning performance. Finally, we illustrated our method using some typical path planning tasks. The experimental results show that our DRL method can converge much easier and faster than other methods. The resulting action neural network is able to successfully guide robots from any start position in the environment to the goal position while following the optimal path and avoiding collision with obstacles.",collision avoidance | continuous state space | deep reinforcement learning | dynamic programming | global optimal path planning | mobile robots | shortest path,3,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,NSERC,210471,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Firstly, a lightweight YoloFastestV2 deep learning model combined with NCNN and Mobile Neural Network (MNN) inference frameworks is used to obtain preliminary semantic information of images. The dynamic feature points are removed according to epipolar constraint and dynamic properties of objects between consecutive frames. Since reducing the number of feature points after rejection affects the pose estimation, this paper innovatively combines Cylinder and Plane Extraction (CAPE) planar detection. We generate planes from depth maps and then introduce planar and in-plane point constraints into the nonlinear optimization of SLAM. Finally, the algorithm is tested on the publicly available TUM (RGB-D) dataset, and the average improvement in localization accuracy over ORB-SLAM2, DS-SLAM, and RDMO-SLAM is about 91.95%, 27.21%, and 30.30% under dynamic sequences, respectively. The single-frame tracking time of the whole system is only 42.68 ms, which is 44.1%, being 14.6–34.33% higher than DS-SLAM, RDMO-SLAM, and RDS-SLAM respectively.

Notably, a realistic 3D simulator based on an Unreal Engine was created to generate a synthetic dataset under different weather conditions. A transfer learning technique was used to train the encoder-decoder model to segment free space from the occupied sidewalk environment. The local planner uses a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme that inputs the estimated drivable space, the state of the robot, and a global plan to produce safe velocity commands that minimize the tracking cost and actuator effort while avoiding collisions with dynamic and static obstacles. The proposed approach achieves zero-shot transfer from a simulation to real-world environments that have never been experienced during training.

Camera2 API of the Android platform has been used for camera access and operations. The network then classifies images as positive or negative for monkeypox detection. The network’s training has been carried out using skin lesion images of monkeypox-infected people and other skin lesion images. For this purpose, a publicly available dataset and a deep transfer learning approach have been used. All training and testing steps have been applied on Matlab using different pre-trained networks. Then, the network that has the best accuracy has been recreated and trained using TensorFlow. The TensorFlow model has been adapted to mobile devices by converting to the TensorFlow Lite model.

To solve these limitations, we proposed an improved SSA algorithm (OOSSA) which integrates orthogonal refracted opposition-based learning strategy and self-adaptive inertia weight strategy into SSA. In orthogonal refracted learning strategy, the refracted opposition-based learning based on the optical lens imaging principle was employed to enhance the exploration scope of the inverse solution space, which greatly reduced the probability of the algorithm falling into the local optimum. The orthogonal experimental design was used to construct several partial opposite solutions that take the refracted-based inverse values in part of the dimension, so as to deeply mine and preserve the dominant dimensional information of the current individual and the refracted-based opposite individual. In addition, an adaptive inertia weight was introduced in the follower position update phase to effectively improve the follower search pattern and enhance the local exploitation ability of the algorithm. The CEC2017 benchmark functions were employed for simulation experiments. Also, Wilcoxon ' s rank-sum test and Friedman test were performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed OOSSA outperformed the basic SSA, eight improved SSA variants, and nine cutting-edge swarm-based intelligence algorithms. Moreover, the algorithm was applied to an engineering design problem, and results show that the algorithm had better performance than other algorithms in engineering optimization. Finally, an OOSSA-based robot path planning approach was developed for solving the path planning problem in autonomous mobile robots. The proposed algorithm was simulated in three environment settings and compared with other algorithms including particle swarm optimization (PSO), artificial bee colony (ABC), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), firefly algorithm (FA), and SSA. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm could plan the optimal collision-free paths compared with its competitors.

While robots liberate humans from tedious and dangerous work in hazardous environments, AI simplifies the programming of robots by automatically inferring patterns and models from the interaction between the robots and the environment. Nevertheless, the application of robots and AI to more general manufacturing and social tasks is still limited by the lack of flexibility and adaptability to the changes in the task and the environment. Thus, a new concept, adaptive robotics, has been proposed to address the desire that an AI-powered robot should be able to properly reprogram itself to these changes without human intervention. Nevertheless, this concept is yet too abstract to provide any specific guidance to the development of robot programs. In this paper, we attempt to provide methodical redefinition and reformulation of adaptive robotics both in conceptual and mathematical manners based on the study of previous results. First of all, we introduce the essential motivation and the conceptual origination of adaptability of mechanical systems. Then, we review the previous literature and explore the related work of adaptive robotics. Based on this, we provide a uniform mathematical formulation of adaptive robotics based on adaptive and robust Markov-decision process (MDP).

To avoid tracking failure, while simultaneously ensuring adequate exploration, a novel active vSLAM framework with camera view planning based on generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) is proposed to actively adjust the orientation of the camera during robot motion. First, the Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF-SLAM2 (ORB-SLAM2) method is modified to reconstruct a three-channel navigation map that contains information about obstacles and explored areas. Second, a large number of view planning behaviors of human beings are collected in different indoor environments as the expert demonstration. Last, to make the robot imitate the human searching behaviors, the structures of the actor, critic, and discriminator networks are designed, and the GAIL method is used to train the camera view planning policy. Simulation results on a public dataset of indoor environments show that the proposed GAIL-SLAM framework improves the exploration coverage ratio of unknown environments by an average of 53.08% (34.21% for traditional vs. 87.29% for our proposed).

In this paper, we introduce a motion planning framework consisting of two components: a data-driven policy that uses visual inputs and human feedback to generate socially compliant driving behaviors (encoded by high-level decision variables), and a local trajectory optimization method that executes these behaviors (ensuring safety). In particular, we employ Interactive Imitation Learning to jointly train the policy with the local planner, a Model Predictive Controller (MPC), which results in safe and human-like driving behaviors. Our approach is validated in realistic simulated urban scenarios. Qualitative results show the similarity of the learned behaviors with human driving.

The algorithm consists of two components: (a) Spatial Component, which learns the setting of the environment, i.e., on which pixels to focus on most to get the best representation of the image regardless of point of view, and (b) Temporal Component that learns how snapshots taken from multiple viewpoints simultaneously (i.e., at the same time-step but from a different viewpoint) are similar and how these snaps are different from snaps taken at a different time-step but same viewpoint. Further, these representations are integrated with the Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to learn accurate behaviors from videos of humans performing the manipulation task.

However, very scarce is known about the challenges of using programmable robots as a tool to empower children in minority communities. This mixed-methods case study examined a Free Quality Kindergarten situated in a low-income public housing estate in Hong Kong to explore the affordances and challenges of robot programming (RP) in early childhood education (ECE). Both quantitative and qualitative data were generated through videotaped observations, child assessments and teacher interviews to journey with the teaching team as they managed to implement the newly introduced RP curriculum. Child assessment evidence revealed that there was a statistically significant improvement in CT scores over 6 weeks of RP activities, while the pretest–posttest change of child self-regulation scores was nonsignificant. Video analysis results further revealed that children's interaction level with the robot kit significantly predicted the change of self-regulation over time. Qualitative results are presented to explicate the micro, meso and macro conditions that constrain the implementation of RP curriculum, including the following: (a) teachers' limited TPACK in RP education, (b) a disconnect between the RP curriculum and the school-based curriculum, (c) limited resources and (d) the Confucian tradition and cultural barriers. These illustrate the intricacies involved in the implementation of RP education to empower marginalized children in under-resourced ECE settings. This study will help bring systemic change to the ECE field by uncovering ecological difficulties in integrating new technologies to promote inclusiveness and sustainability for the future. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Screen-free robot programming (RP) is beneficial for preschool children in terms of promoting their computational thinking (CT) and executive functioning. RP can be generally engaging for preschool children from a middle-class background. What this paper adds The study is addressing the inclusiveness and sustainability according to the learning needs of kindergarten students, especially those from less privileged backgrounds. The story-based approach to RP can cater to the learning needs and interests of children from a lower socio-economic background, which is likely to enhance their CT skills. Children with a higher level of interaction with the robot kit benefited more from the RP activities in terms of self-regulation skills. This study used multiple methods (ie, video analysis, teacher interview and child assessment) to reveal the effects of micro, meso and macro contexts on RP education in an under-resourced Hong Kong kindergarten. Implications for practice and/or policy RP education should be cautiously prompted in diverse early childhood settings, especially the less privileged institutions, to enhance positive effects. Critical constraints on the use of programmable robots to empower marginalized children should be adequately addressed when trying to integrate RP into early childhood education. Teachers should receive training and continual support in RP-related pedagogical strategies to facilitate and scaffold children's learning.",child–robot interaction | computational thinking | early childhood education | robot programming | sociocultural influences,4,0,,,EdUHK,RG 84/2020‐2021R,Education University of Hong Kong

To address this verification challenge formally, we present a methodology to encode the verification problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Our encoding is based on the bit-precise semantics of quantized neural networks, which ensures the soundness of our method. We implement our verification methodology using the Gurobi MILP solver and evaluate it on several widely used DNN benchmarks. We compare our method with state-of-the-art bit-vector encodings, which are outperformed by our MILP-based verification methodology by an order of magnitude in most cases.

To address these issues, we consider the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to overcome the signal blockage and assist the trajectory design among multiple robots. Meanwhile, the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is adopted to cope with the scarcity of spectrum and enhance the connectivity of robots. Considering the limited battery capacity of robots, we aim to maximize the energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the transmit power of the access point (AP), the phase shifts of the RIS, and the trajectory of robots. A novel federated deep reinforcement learning (F-DRL) approach is developed to solve this challenging problem with one dynamic long-term objective. Through each robot planning its path and downlink power, the AP only needs to determine the phase shifts of the RIS, which can significantly save the computation overhead due to the reduced training dimension. Simulation results reveal the following findings: i) the proposed F-DRL can reduce at least 86% convergence time compared to the centralized DRL; ii) the designed algorithm can adapt to the increasing number of robots; iii) compared to traditional OMA-based benchmarks, NOMA-enhanced schemes can achieve higher energy efficiency.",Federated deep reinforcement learning | indoor robot communication | reconfigurable intelligent surface,5,0,repositoryam,Green,NSFC,62071068,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Most studies of these applications have examined small programs that fit within a single screen, yet real-world programs often grow large, and editing these large block-based programs quickly becomes unwieldy. Traditional programming language features, like functions, allow programmers to decompose their programs. Unfortunately, both previous work, and our own findings, suggest that end-users rarely use these features, resulting in large monolithic code blocks that are hard to understand. In this work, we introduce a block-based system that provides users with a hierarchical, domain-specific program structure and requires them to decompose their programs accordingly. Through a user study with 92 users, we compared this approach, which we call guided program decomposition, to a traditional system that supports functions, but does not require decomposition. We found that while almost all users could successfully complete smaller tasks, those who decomposed their programs were significantly more successful as the tasks grew larger. As expected, most users without guided decomposition did not decompose their programs, resulting in poor performance on larger problems. In comparison, users of guided decomposition performed significantly better on the same tasks. Though this study investigated only a limited selection of tasks in one specific domain, it suggests that guided decomposition can benefit end-user programmers. While no single decomposition strategy fits all domains, we believe that similar domain-specific sub-hierarchies could be found for other application areas, increasing the scale of code end-users can create and understand.",block-based programming | mobile robots | program decomposition,0,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,2024561,National Science Foundation

Introductory robot programming languages often extend existing block-based languages such as Scratch. While teaching programming with such languages is well established, the interaction with the real world in robot programs leads to specific challenges, for which learners and educators may require assistance and feedback. A practical approach to provide this feedback is by identifying and pointing out patterns in the code that are indicative of good or bad solutions. While such patterns have been defined for regular block-based programs, robot-specific programming aspects have not been considered so far. The aim of this paper is therefore to identify patterns specific to robot programming for the Scratch-based mBlock programming language, which is used for the popular mBot and Codey Rocky robots. We identify: (1) 26 bug patterns, which indicate erroneous code; (2) three code smells, which indicate code that may work but is written in a confusing or difficult to understand way; and (3) 18 code perfumes, which indicate aspects of code that are likely good. We extend the LitterBox analysis framework to automatically identify these patterns in mBlock programs. Evaluated on a dataset of 3,540 mBlock programs, we find a total of 6,129 instances of bug patterns, 592 code smells and 14,495 code perfumes. This demonstrates the potential of our approach to provide feedback and assistance to learners and educators alike for their mBlock robot programs.",Block-based programming | Code quality | Linting | mBlock | Robot,0,0,repositoryam,Green,BMBF,01JA1924,Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung

As a key cognition task for all the autonomous machines, motion planning is fundamentally required in various real-world robotic applications, such as 2-D/3-D autonomous navigation of unmanned mobile and aerial vehicles and high degree-of-freedom (DoF) autonomous manipulation of industry/medical robot arms and graspers. Motion planning can be performed using either non-learningbased classical algorithms or learning-based neural approaches. Most recently, the powerful capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs) make neural planners become very attractive because of their superior planning performance over the classical methods. In particular, graph neural network (GNN)-enabled motion planner has demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance across a set of challenging high-dimensional planning tasks, motivating the efficient hardware acceleration to fully unleash its potential and promote its widespread deployment in practical applications. To that end, in this paper we perform preliminary study of the efficient accelerator design of the GNN-based neural planner, especially for the neural explorer as the key component of the entire planning pipeline. By performing in-depth analysis on the different design choices, we identify that the hybrid architecture, instead of the uniform sparse matrix multiplication (SpMM)-based solution that is popularly adopted in the existing GNN hardware, is more suitable for our target neural explorer. With a set of optimization on microarchitecture and dataflow, several design challenges incurred by using hybrid architecture, such as extensive memory access and imbalanced workload, can be efficiently mitigated. Evaluation results show that our proposed customized hardware architecture achieves order-of-magnitude performance improvement over the CPU/GPU-based implementation with respect to area and energy efficiency in various working environments.",Hardware Accelerator | Motion Planning | Neural Network,0,0,,,,undefined,

Bi-directional sketching enables virtual sketches and physical objects to ""affect""each other through physical actuation and digital computation. In the existing AR sketching, the relationship between virtual and physical worlds is only one-directional - while physical interaction can affect virtual sketches, virtual sketches have no return effect on the physical objects or environment. In contrast, bi-directional sketching interaction allows the seamless coupling between sketches and actuated TUIs. In this paper, we employ tabletop-size small robots (Sony Toio) and an iPad-based AR sketching tool to demonstrate the concept. In our system, virtual sketches drawn and simulated on an iPad (e.g., lines, walls, pendulums, and springs) can move, actuate, collide, and constrain physical Toio robots, as if virtual sketches and the physical objects exist in the same space through seamless coupling between AR and robot motion. This paper contributes a set of novel interactions and a design space of bi-directional AR sketching.

The authors conducted iterative rounds of qualitative coding of video recordings in kindergarten classrooms and interaction analysis of children using coding robots. Findings: The authors found that as children repaired bugs at the level of the program and at the level of the physical apparatus, they were performing essential technical knowledge; the authors focus on how demonstrating technical knowledge was organized pedagogically and collectively achieved. Originality/value: Drawing broadly from studies of the social organization of technical work in professional settings, we argue that technical knowledge is easy to overlook but essential for learning to repair programs.

The primary contribution of this exploratory research is how educational research informs technological advances in triggering a virtual AI companion (AIC) for children in need of social-emotional and communication skills development. The AIC adapts to students’ varying levels of needed support. This project began by using puppetry control (human-in-the-loop) of the AIC, assisting students with ASD in learning basic coding, practicing their social skills with the AIC, and attaining emotional recognition and regulation skills for effective communication and learning. The student is given the challenge to program a robot, Dash™, to move in a square. Based on observed behaviors, the puppeteer controls the virtual agent’s actions to support the student in coding the robot. The virtual agent’s actions that inform the development of the AIC include speech, facial expressions, gestures, respiration, and heart color changes coded to indicate emotional state.

The outcomes discussed align with a common approach of research design used for students with disabilities, called single case study research. This type of design does not involve random control trial research; instead, the student acts as her or his own control subject. Students with ASD have substantial individual differences in their social skill deficits, behaviors, communications, and learning needs, which vary greatly from the norm and from other individuals identified with this disability. Therefore, findings are reported as changes within subjects instead of across subjects. While these exploratory observations serve as a basis for longer term research on a larger population, this paper focuses less on student learning and more on evolving technology in AIC and supporting students with ASD in STEM environments.",artificial intelligence | autism spectrum disorder | communication skills | digital puppetry | robotics | single case study design | virtual learning environment | visual programming,5,1,,,NSF,1725554,National Science Foundation

More importantly, collaborative robots allow operators to teach end-effector trajectories by means of physical interaction – known as kinesthetic teaching – which is one of the most intuitive programming-by-demonstration techniques. However, important functionalities provided by modern collaborative robots, like the possibility of performing smooth interactions, cannot be programmed intuitively with the available framework of kinesthetic teaching. In the present study, we propose and experimentally evaluate a robot programming framework for the simultaneous teaching of both trajectories by means of kinesthetic teaching, and robot interaction behavior by means of impedance shaping along the trajectory exploiting a wearable interface. Specifically, the wearable interface is designed to not affect the free motion of the operator, necessary to perform kinesthetic teaching, and it is based on the usage of surface electromyography (sEMG) and vibrotactile stimulation. In this way, we propose an intuitive robot programming framework for an offline robot trajectory and interaction behavior programming, according to which the operator will be able to plan interactions with the environment and humans. In this article, we report a preliminary experimental evaluation of the proposed system, in which an operator will teach a 7-degrees-of-freedom manipulator the execution of a task on a robotic wiring test-bed. In the experiment, the programming of requested compliance levels during the kinesthetic teaching of a trajectory is performed, and the reported results show that the provided wearable interface is successfully exploited by the operator.

This manuscript concerns designing a wireless sensor network system that facilitates open-source hardware platforms, ZigBee and Raspberry Pi. The embedded system architecture combines the gateway node of the wireless sensor network, database server, and web server in one single-board computer (SBC) hardware platform. The design reduces power consumption and cost by developing better scalability and lesser sensors units to improve sending and receiving data. The use of Raspberry Pi in the design enhances flexibility and reduces the cost. Further, using the Python code in programming minimizes the codes of the components and avoids errors. The choice of the Raspbian operating system for Raspberries has resulted in higher quality, better stability, and a smoother scalable operating system. Raspberry Pi acts as a base station for the ZigBee protocol. Additionally, data can be transferred remotely at the base station via the website. The advantage of using python in the programming makes the work on the Raspberry easier and faster, and the language learning becomes easier than before. The other advantage of this technique is to allow sending the data to any Raspberry by clicking special buttons on the GUI, capability to work with both multicast- and unicast-based communication schemes, and to work as router and end tag(E52) to enable sending the real-time data to the nearest router. Analytically, the new design provides a maximum transmit power of 20 dBm12 compared to 18 dBs and increase the output power increases by a little more than 2 dB.",Design | Embedded | SBC | ZigBee,0,0,,,,undefined,

Revealing spatial distribution from terrain geometry to rover slip behavior is key to assessing prospective traversability, but is hindered by insufficient in situ measurements on hazardous states due to conservative rover traverses. To achieve a more accurate prediction, this letter proposes a framework that actively learns latent traversability by exploring informative terrain under the constraints of stochastic rover slip. With a Gaussian process (GP) modeling the spatial distribution, we devise an iterative two-stage framework that gradually refines the model estimation, combining risk-aware informative path planning and GP updates by taking in situ measurements. The path planning stage employs our designed sampling-based algorithm to generate informative trajectories with fault-tolerant risk inference, while the GP is cautiously updated with traverse data to avoid rover immobilization. Chance constraint formulation is exploited in the framework to infer the stochastic reachability of informative regions. Through GP estimates reducing uncertainty, the algorithm incrementally reaches informative yet hazardous states along feasible trajectories. Simulation studies in rough terrain environments demonstrate that the proposed framework gathers informative traverse data while averting rover stuck situations to estimate the latent traversability model.",Field robots | motion and path planning | probabilistic inference | space robotics and automation,2,0,,,,undefined,

Therefore, by learning the feasibility of each mode from the geometric variables, the problem can be solved efficiently within a given time limit. The feasibility of grasp poses is related to the pose of the object and nearby obstacles. Utilizing this information, we introduce learned geometric feasibility (LGF), which prioritizes the integer search of MIP.

Because the workspace of the soft arm is affected by the loads or interaction, it is difficult to implement this task through the motion planning method.

We first generate a controller for the soft arm based on Q-learning, which can operate the arm while satisfying the pose constraints when the arm is neither loaded nor interacted with the environment. Then, we introduce a process that adjusts corresponding Q values in the controller, which allows the controller to operate the arm with an unknown load or interaction while still satisfying the pose constraints.

However, modern optimization-based methods use the precomputed signed distance function for collision loss estimation, and it limits the application of these methods for general configuration spaces, including a differential drive non-circular robot with non-holonomic constraints.

However, teaching a new perceptual concept from high-dimensional robot sensor data (e.g., point clouds) is demanding, requiring an unrealistic amount of human labels. To address this, we propose a framework called Perceptual Concept Bootstrapping (PCB). First, we leverage the inherently lower-dimensional privileged information, e.g., object poses and bounding boxes, available from a simulator only at training time to rapidly learn a low-dimensional, geometric concept from minimal human input. Second, we treat this low-dimensional concept as an automatic labeler to synthesize a large-scale high-dimensional data set with the simulator. With these two key ideas, PCB alleviates human label burden while still learning perceptual concepts that work with real sensor input where no privileged information is available. We evaluate PCB for learning spatial concepts that describe object state or multi-object relationships, and show it achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods. We also demonstrate the utility of the learned concepts in motion planning tasks on a 7-DoF Franka Panda robot.",human factors and human-in-the-loop | Human-centered robotics | visual learning,2,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Chattering becomes more prominent in cases where the environment changes rapidly, possibly even causing the MPPI to diverge. To address this issue, we propose a method that seamlessly combines MPPI with an input-lifting strategy. In addition, we introduce a new action cost to smooth control sequence during trajectory rollouts while preserving the information theoretic interpretation of MPPI, which was derived from non-affine dynamics.

Symbolic methods build modular systems with semantic parsing and task planning modules for producing sequences of actions from natural language requests. Modern connectionist methods employ deep neural networks that learn visual and linguistic features for mapping inputs to a sequence of low-level actions, in an end-to-end fashion. The hybrid, modular system blends these two approaches to create a modular framework: it formulates instruction following as symbolic goal learning via deep neural networks followed by task planning via symbolic planners. Connectionist and symbolic modules are bridged with Planning Domain Definition Language. The vision-and-language learning network predicts its goal representation, which is sent to a planner for producing a task-completing action sequence. For improving the flexibility of natural language, we further incorporate implicit human intents with explicit human instructions. To learn generic features for vision and language, we propose to separately pretrain vision and language encoders on scene graph parsing and semantic textual similarity tasks.

We address I) by learning a causal Bayesian network from simulation data. Concerning II), we propose a novel method that enables robots to generate contrastive explanations upon task failures. The explanation is based on setting the failure state in contrast with the closest state that would have allowed for successful execution. This state is found through breadth-first search and is based on success predictions from the learned causal model. We assessed our method in two different scenarios I) stacking cubes and II) dropping spheres into a container. The obtained causal models reach a sim2real accuracy of 70% and 72%, respectively.

A good code summary is supposed to have the following characteristics: complete information, correct meaning, and consistent description. In recent years, numerous approaches have been proposed for code summarization, but it is still very challenging for developers to automatically learn the complex semantics from the source code and generate complete, correct and consistent code summaries. Objective: In this paper, we propose KGCodeSum, a novel keyword-guided abstractive code summarization approach that incorporates structural and contextual information. Methods: To improve summaries’ quality, we leverage both the structural information embedded in code itself and the contextual information from related code snippets. Meanwhile, we make use of keywords to guide summaries’ generation to guarantee the code summaries contain key information. Finally, we propose a new dynamic vocabulary strategy which can effectively resolve the UNK problems in code summaries. Results: Through our evaluation on the large-scale benchmark datasets with 2.1 million java method-comment pairs and 1.1 million C/C++ function-summary pairs, We have observed that our approach could generate better code summaries than existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of completeness, correctness and consistency.

Considering unknown terrains, its impedance model can be transferred to a quadratic programming problem with specified constraints, which a designed primal-dual optimization prototype then solves. Then, the presented impedance learning strategy is introduced to regulate the impedance model with the adaptive assistant powers for humans on different terrains. An adaptive controller is designed in the inner loop to balance the nonlinearities and compliance existing in the human-exosuit coexistence, while the robust mechanism compensates for disturbances to facilitate trajectory management without employing the general regressor.

The collision detector should be computationally efficient and, ideally, analytically differentiable to facilitate stable and rapid gradient descent during optimization. However, methods today lack an elegant approach to detect collision differentiably, relying rather on numerical gradients that can be unstable. We present DiffCo, the first, fully autodifferentiable, nonparametric model for collision detection. Its nonparametric behavior allows one to compute collision boundaries on the fly and update them, requiring no pretraining and allowing it to update continuously in dynamic environments. It provides robust gradients for trajectory optimization via backpropagation and is often 10-100 times faster to compute than its geometric counterparts.

The key is to build a profound understanding of the crowd for mobile robots, which is the basis of a proactive and foresighted policy. However, since the interaction mechanisms among pedestrians are complex and sophisticated, it is difficult to describe and model them accurately. For the excellent approximation capability of deep neural networks, deep reinforcement learning is a promising solution to the problem. However, current model-free learning-based approaches in crowd navigation always neglect planning and still lead to reactive collision avoidance policies and shortsighted behaviors. Meanwhile, most model-based learning-based approaches are based on state values, imposing a substantial computational burden. To address these problems, we propose a graph-based deep reinforcement learning method, social graph-based double dueling deep Q-network (SG-D3QN), that (i) introduces a social attention mechanism to extract an efficient graph representation for the crowd-robot state, (ii) extends the previous state value approximator to a state-action value approximator, (iii) further optimizes the state-action value approximator with simulated experiences generated by the learned environment model, and (iv) then proposes a human-like decision-making process by integrating model-free reinforcement learning and online planning. Experimental results indicate that our approach helps the robot understand the crowd and achieves a high success rate of more than 0.99 in the crowd navigation task. Compared with previous state-of-the-art algorithms, our approach achieves better performance.

The expressiveness of neural-network features trained offline, paired with efficient last-layer online adaptation, enables the derivation of tight confidence sets, which contract around the true dynamics as the model adapts online. We exploit these confidence sets to plan trajectories that guarantee the safety of the system. Our approach handles problems with high dynamics uncertainty, where reaching the goal safely is potentially initially infeasible, by first exploring to gather data and reduce uncertainty, before autonomously exploiting the acquired information to safely perform the task. Under reasonable assumptions, we prove that our framework guarantees the high-probability satisfaction of all constraints at all times jointly, i.e., over the total task duration.

To reduce the time cost of data acquisition and labeling and increase the rate of successful grasps, we developed a self-supervised learning mechanism to control grasp tasks performed by manipulators. First, a manipulator automatically collects the point cloud for the objects from multiple perspectives to increase the efficiency of data acquisition. The complete point cloud for the objects is obtained using the hand-eye vision of the manipulator and the truncated signed distance function algorithm. Then, the point cloud data for the objects are used to generate a series of six-degrees-of-freedom grasp poses, and the force-closure decision algorithm is used to add the grasp quality label to each grasp pose to realize the automatic labeling of grasp data. Finally, the point cloud in the gripper closing area corresponding to each grasp pose is obtained and used to train the grasp-quality classification model for the manipulator. The results of performing actual grasping experiments demonstrate that the proposed self-supervised learning method can increase the rate of successful grasps for the manipulator. Note to Practitioners-Most of the existing grasp planning methods of the manipulator are based on public datasets or simulation data to train model algorithms. Owing to the limited types of objects, the limited amount of data in the public datasets, and the lack of real sensor noise in the simulation data, the robustness of the trained algorithm model is insufficient, and it is difficult to apply to unstructured production environments. To solve the above problems, we propose a 6-DOF capture planning method based on self-supervised learning and introduce a self-supervised learning mechanism to solve the problem of grasp data acquisition in real scenes. The manipulator automatically collects object data from multiple perspectives, performs desktop-level 3D reconstruction, and finally uses the force-closure decision algorithm to automatically label the data in order to realize automatic acquisition and labeling of the grasp data in a real scenario. Preliminary experiments show that this method can obtain high-quality grasp data and can be applied to grasp operations in real multi-target and cluttered environments. However, it has not been tested in actual production environments. This paper focuses on the data acquisition module in the 6-DOF grasp planning framework.

Sampling-based algorithms have gained great success in solving path planning problems in 3D space, but the quality of the initial path is not guaranteed and the convergence to the optimal solution is slow. To address these problems, in this article, we present a novel sampling-based path planning framework enhanced by the deep neural network (DNN) with applications to 3D space. In the proposed framework, we first train the DNN with a number of successful path planning cases in 3D space. Then the DNN is utilized to predict the promising region where the feasible path probably exists for a given path planning problem. This predicted promising region serves as a nonuniform sampling heuristic to bias the sampling process of the path planner. In this way, the path planner can focus on the promising region in the exploration and exploitation process so that the path planning speed gets accelerated. We conduct numerical simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and the results show that it can perform much better than conventional path planning algorithms. Furthermore, we also investigate the performance of different DNN architectures for path planning in 3D space. Note to Practitioners-In this work, we aim to provide an efficient learning-based method to accelerate the robot path planning process in 3D space. Conventional path planning algorithms need to perceive the environment first, and then implement a series of calculations such as collision checking and data storing to generate a feasible path. When facing complex and high-dimensional environments, they do not perform well. But the proposed neural network method in this article can predict the promising region where the feasible path exists for any given environment. This prediction result is used to guide the path planning process so that the algorithm performance can get significantly improved.

In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework, called multiple state spaces reasoning reinforcement learning (SRRL), to endow the agent with the primary reasoning capability. First, we abstract the implicit and latent links between multiple state spaces. Then, we embed historical ob-servations through a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to preserve long-term memories and dependen-cies. The proposed SRRL’s ability of abstraction and long-term memory enables agents to execute long-horizon robotic searching and planning tasks more quickly and reasonably by exploiting the correlation between radio frequency identification (RFID) sensing properties and the environment occupation map.

In this work, we propose an intermediate language (between blocks and traditional language that focuses on Arduino, allowing a wide range and student-designed projects. Preliminary results show that our language is simpler than the native Arduino language and that it would be a preferred alternative for beginner students of a computer science undergraduate course.",domain-specific language | open-source | robot-based. | teaching programming,0,0,,,,undefined,

For instance, in natural language one uses expressions such as ""Region X is located inside or north of Region Y""or ""Task A is scheduled after or during Task B""to spatially or temporally relate one object with another object or oneself, without resorting to providing quantitative information about these entities. In brief, QSTR simplifies complex mathematical theories that revolve around spatial and temporal entities to manageable qualitative constraint languages (calculi), which can in turn give rise to interpretable spatio-temporal representations. Thus, QSTR forms a concise and explainable paradigm for dealing with entities pertaining to space and time, with the potential to boost research in a plethora of domains that can range anywhere from theoretical computer science and logic to practical algorithms and applications. In this tutorial, we take a twofold approach to introducing our audience to the rich research area of Qualitative Spatial and Temporal Reasoning. First, we present the scientific background in detail, mentioning some terminology, key definitions, and problems associated with the field, and follow up with a presentation of the state-of-the-art frameworks that exist for handling QSTR data, focusing on native methods and Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and Answer Set Programming (ASP) approaches. Secondly, and most importantly, we address the gap that exists between QSTR - a symbolic paradigm - and Machine Learning, and bring forward some successful examples of neuro-symbolic integration in the context of spatio-temporal information from the recent literature; we argue for further pursuing this promising research direction and explain the current challenges that need to be overcome for obtaining hybrid AI systems that can be applied to highly active areas such as planning, data mining, and robotic applications.",Integration | Machine Learning | Spatial and Temporal Knowledge | Symbolic AI,0,0,,,,undefined,

When planning a path, features such as the terrain gradient and roughness should be considered, and they can jointly represent the traversability cost of the terrain. Despite this range of contributing factors, most cost maps are currently binary in nature, solely indicating traversible versus non-traversible areas. This work presents a joint local and global planning methodology for building continuous cost maps using LIDAR, based on a novel traversability representation of the environment. We investigate two approaches. The first, a statistical approach, computes terrain cost directly from the point cloud. The second, a learning-based approach, predicts an IMU response solely from geometric point cloud data using a 2D-Convolutional-LSTM neural network. This allows us to estimate the cost of a patch without directly driving over it, based on a data set that maps IMU signals to point cloud patches. Based on the terrain analysis, two continuous cost maps are generated to jointly select the optimal path considering distance and traversability cost for local navigation. We present a real-time terrain analysis strategy applicable for local planning, and furthermore demonstrate the straightforward application of the same approach in batch mode for global planning. Off-road autonomous driving experiments in a large and hybrid site illustrate the applicability of the method.

One common task of robotic cells in manufacturing is called homing, a step that enables a robotic arm to return to its initial / home position (HPos) from anywhere in a robotic cell, without collision or experiencing robot singularities while respecting its joint limits. In almost all industrial robotic cells, an operation cycle starts from, and ends to HPos. The home position also works as a safe state for a cycle to restart when an alarm or fault occurs within the cell. When an alarm occurs, the robot configuration in the cell is unpredictable, thus challenging to bring the robot, autonomously and with safety at HPos and restart the operation. This paper presents a non-vision, reinforcement learning-based approach of a parallel-agent setting to enable self-homing capability in industrial robotic cells, eliminating the need of manual programming of robot manipulators. This approach assumes the sensing of an unknown robotic cell environment pre-encoded in the state definition so that the policies learned can be transferred without further training. The agents are trained in a simulation environment generated by the mechanical design of an actual robotic cell to increase the accuracy of mapping the real environment to the simulated one. The approach explores the impact of certain curriculum on the agent's learning and evaluates two choices, compared to a non-curriculum baseline. A parallel-agent, multi-process training setting is employed to enhance performance in exploring the state space, where experiences are shared among the agents via shared memory. Upon deployment, all agents are involved with their respective policies in a collective manner. The approach has been demonstrated in simulated industrial robotic cells, and it has been shown that the policies derived in simulation are transferable to a corresponding real industrial robotic cells, and are generalizable to other robotic systems in manufacturing settings.",industrial robotic manipulator | parallel-agent | reinforcement learning | self-homing,2,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,

This course is designed to give students, regardless of their intended major in engineering, broad knowledge in manufacturing via 10 engineering, 3 social science, and 10 technical communication lectures; 8 labs; and 4 projects. The social science lectures and discussions focus on how knowledge about society can be used to inform design and manufacturing decisions, social science research methods for understanding how engineers and technology can impact people's lives, and changing trends in work, the workplace, and the future workforce as it relates to manufacturing. This course aimed to give undergraduate first-year engineering students a positive view of advanced manufacturing and its impact on society. Student evaluations and comments were positive and affirmed the learning objective of teaching manufacturing to the first-year engineering students. The flipped classroom approach was demonstrated to be ideal during the COVID-19 pandemic with limited capacity for in-person lectures and labs. The use of flipped classrooms allowed students to learn at their own pace, review and reinforce knowledge, have a closer interaction with instructors, and reduce the number of technical errors using simulation tools.

An increasing number of robots are currently being used to perform complex tasks during manual operation, e.g., the grinding of large components using multi-robot systems and robot teleoperation in dangerous environments, and machining conditions have evolved from a single open mode to a multisystem closed mode. Because the environment is constantly changing with multiple systems interacting with each other, traditional methods, such as mechanism modeling and programming are no longer applicable. Intelligent learning models, such as deep learning, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and imitation learning, have been widely used; thus, skill learning and strategy optimization have become the focus of research on robot machining. Skill learning in robot machining can use robotic flexibility to learn skills under unknown working conditions, and machining strategy research can optimize processing quality under complex working conditions. Additionally, skill learning and strategy optimization combined with an intelligent learning model demonstrate excellent performance for data characteristics learning, multisystem transformation, and environment perception, thus compensating for the shortcomings of the traditional research field. This paper summarizes the state-of-the-art in skill learning and strategy optimization research from the perspectives of feature processing, skill learning, strategy, and model optimization of robot grinding and polishing, in which deep learning, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and imitation learning models are integrated into skill learning and strategy optimization during robot grinding and polishing.

The authors’ hypothesis is that an unstructured ER curriculum might be more beneficial in supporting young learners’ group metacognition in programming contexts. This study follows a quasi-experimental design with students (n = 35) split into two comparison groups – a structured ER curriculum group and an unstructured one. The results show that students in the structured curriculum group demonstrated higher levels of group metacognition and better collaboration. Furthermore, using a micro-ecological approach, the study reveals that individual metacognitive contributions from students in the unstructured curriculum group had a systemic impact on the group work progress.",Collaboration | Collaborative problem-solving | Educational robotics | Group metacognition | Productive failure | Programming,2,0,,,H2020,739578,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

The “curse of dimensionality” is the barrier of data fusion in edge devices to the success of IoT intelligence. Deep Learning has attracted a lot of attention recently due to its successful application in various fields such as image processing and natural language processing. However, the success of Deep Learning benefits from the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computing. Similar to conventional Deep Learning, the computational complexity of optimising LAHs blocks the applications of LAHs. However, unlike conventional Deep Learning, an Linguistic Attribute Hierarchy (LAH) embedded with Linguistic Decision Trees (LDTs) could overcome the shortcoming of the lack of interpretation by providing transparent information propagation through the rules created by LDTs in the LAH. To address the challenge in the construction of high-performance LAHs, we propose a heuristic approach for constructing an LAH embedded with LDTs for decision making or classification by using the distance correlations between attributes and between attributes and the target variable. The set of attributes is divided into some attribute clusters and then heuristically organised into an LAH. The proposed approach has been validated on some benchmark decision or classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository. The experimental results show that the proposed self-organisation algorithm can create an effective and efficient LAH. Such a self-organised LAH embedded with LDTs can not only efficiently address “curse of dimensionality” in a single LDT for data fusion with massive attributes, but also achieve better or comparable performance in decision making or classification compared to a single LDT for the problem to be solved. The main contribution of this work is that (1) an LAH provides a new attribute Deep Learning approach with good transparency and extends the conventional Deep Learning, which usually denotes a black-box deep neural network; (2) the self-organisation algorithm for SOLAH is much more efficient than the genetic algorithm in the wrapper for optimising LAHs, and SOLAH can achieve comparable results to the LAH, which was optimised by the genetic algorithm in the wrapper (GAW). This is crucial for edge intelligence and makes it feasible to embed SOLAH and the self-organisation algorithm in edge devices for IoT applications. Hence, this research will take a step towards edge intelligence.",Distance correlation clustering | Edge intelligence | Lab semantics | Linguistic Attribute Hierarchy | Linguistic decision tree | Self-organisation,1,0,,,,undefined,

In this paper, based on Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) and the family of Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) schemes, we propose the GMR-RRT∗ algorithm to achieve fast path planning for mobile robots. The proposed GMR-RRT∗ consists of learning navigation behaviors from human demonstrations and planning a high-quality path for the robot. Using the GMR, the key features of human demonstrations are captured to form a probability density distribution of the human trajectory in the current environment. This distribution is further utilized to guide the RRT scheme's sampling process to generate a feasible path in the current environment quickly. We test the proposed GMR-RRT∗ in different environments, comparing it with three state-of-the-art sampling-based algorithms.

The course is taught in the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Department at the University of Texas at Arlington and is offered as CSE 4356 System on Chip Design for computer engineering undergraduates, as CSE 5356 for computer engineering graduate students, and as EE 5315 for electrical engineering graduate students. It is taught as one course combining all numbers. All students are given the same lectures, course materials, assignments, and projects. Grading standards and expectations are the same for all students as well. The course in its current form was first offered in fall 2020 and was taught online due to COVID-19 restrictions. The course was offered again in fall 2021 in a traditional on-campus, in-person mode of delivery. Two seasoned educators, with more than eighty years of total teaching experience, combined to team teach the course. One also brought more than thirty years of industrial design experience to the course. SoC FPGA devices have been available for use by designers for more than 10 years and are widely used in applications that require both an embedded microcomputer and FPGA-based logic for real-time computationally-intense solutions. Such solutions require skills in C programming, HDL programming, bus topologies forming the bridge between FPGA fabric and the microprocessor space, Linux operating systems and virtualization, and kernel device driver development. The breadth of the skills that were conveyed to students necessitated a team teaching approach to leverage the diverse background of the instructors. With such a wide range of topics, one of the biggest challenges was developing a course that was approachable for a greatly varied population of students - a mix of Computer Engineering (CpE) and Electrical Engineering (EE) students at both the graduate and undergraduate level. Another, perhaps less obvious, challenge was the inherently application focus of the course, which presents challenges to many graduate students whose undergraduate degree lacked a robust hands-on design experience. Selection of an appropriate project was key to making the course effective and providing a fun learning experience for students. The projects were aligned to relevant industry applications, stressing complex modern intellectual property (IP) work flows, while still being approachable to students. The design of a universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART) IP module in 2020 and a serial peripheral interface (SPI) IP module in 2021 were chosen as the projects for the first two offerings of the course. The Terasic/Intel DE1-SoC development board and Intel Quartus Prime 18.1 design software were the technologies chosen for the course. The development board and basic test instruments were provided to each student in a take-home lab kit.

We wrote a lightweight non-preemptive task scheduler, called RIOS. The task scheduler is written in C, but that can be implemented in languages like C++, Java, Python, Javascript, etc., rather than in assembly as is commonplace. As such, RIOS can be copy-pasted directly into a project's source code, and modified as desired. The scheduler code includes a structure to hold features of a periodic task like its period and elapsed time since previous execution, an array to hold all tasks, a technique for using a timer and interrupt-service routine (ISR) to keep time, and code to actually call each task at the appropriate time. We describe the core features of RIOS, and its successful usage in embedded systems courses, enabling students to build powerful concurrent-tasks systems correctly and quickly. Students can extend RIOS to further learn real-time concepts, such as including a deadline per task, or creating alternative scheduling algorithms such as rate monotonic, earliest-deadline-first scheduling, or round-robin scheduling. Students can also add functionality to analyze task execution behavior, such as calculating processor utilization or task jitter. As such, students can learn first-hand how the scheduler piece of a real-time operating system operates. Via aggressive code rewriting and minimization over several years, we reduce RIOS's entire code size to just a few dozen lines. RIOS is currently used by dozens of universities to teach real-time software concepts, reaching thousands of students per year. RIOS is also used by hundreds of practicing embedded systems engineers as well, resulting in faster implementation time and much smaller code size than the alternative of linking in a real-time operating system.

HBCUs are credited with providing a more supportive and nurturing environment that thrives on communal mindsets and practices, emphasizing the importance of relationships, offering opportunities for Black students to ""see themselves"" as part of the academic and social milieu whereas Historically White Institutions (HWIS) are characterized as being hostile and discriminatory. Mentoring is said to be pivotal in the attainment of the PhD. Mentorships have an inherent gatekeeping mechanism, better positioning those who receive effective mentorships while disadvantaging those who do not. It has potential to harm and marginalize when not engaged with deliberate care and a culturally liberative mindset. Mentoring, when not under the thumb of colonizing mindsets, can contribute to more equitable experiences and outcomes for students who hail from AGEP population groups. Literature has indicated that Black students are less likely to have a mentor or be engaged in effective mentorships. The HBCU narrative of supportive environment is consistently told but has scant empirical validation for Black students pursuing STEM doctoral degrees. In fact, the lure of having faculty and peers who look like you is something of an enigma given that even at HBCUs there are limited numbers of Black faculty in STEM. How are same race, same gender mentorships attained when, not unlike their HWIS counterparts, HBCU STEM faculties have a large number of White and Asian men? If the environment is indeed different at HBCUs, is it different for Black STEM doctoral students? Is STEM doctoral mentoring at HBCUs emblematic of anti-Blackness or is it yet another tool used to oppress marginalized students? Theoretical Framework: Anti-black racism and critical capital theory serve as critical theoretical frameworks and were selected because they highlight the ways violence is enacted through taken for granted colonized practices such as mentoring. Fanon understood that thoughts and mindsets are the progenitors of violence and dehumanization is the process through which violence is enacted. Anti-black racism and critical capital theory can be useful in unearthing the structural inequalities that uphold the current system in place for STEM doctoral learning. Research Design: An embedded multiple qualitative case study research project sought to understand the nature and quality of STEM doctoral mentorships at an HBCU. The analysis on the HBCU subcase asked, how are STEM doctoral mentorships understood by Black STEM doctoral students at HBCUs? Black STEM HBCU students were interviewed and completed a mentoring competency assessment survey. In addition STEM doctoral students from three universities also completed the survey. The qualitative data was analyzed using narrative analysis and the survey data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. This project is part of a larger NSF AGEP sponsored research study. Research findings: The findings from this study expose that Black STEM doctoral students at HBCUs have not reached the proverbial Promise Land. In spite of being in a space that is more diverse, they manage to simultaneously be invisible and hypervisible. An unmerited sense of assumed cultural belonging was highlighted with students reporting a lack of selfethnic reflectors in their programs. In many ways the systemic and institutional structures on HBCUs with respect to STEM doctoral programming mirrored the colonial structures more often associated with HWIS. Their culture and cultural-based experiences as domestic students as well as their academic strengths were often not recognized by mentors while that of international students were. Three themes were supported by the data: Conspicuous Absence, Race Still Matters, and Invisibilized Hypervisibility. Implications: Better understanding how STEM doctoral mentoring is facilitated at HBCUs holds the promise of informing a mentoring practice that supports cultural liberation instead of cultural degradation and suppression. It becomes one avenue as the “The Call'' suggests to ""confront our own complicity in the colonial enterprise"" by holding STEM doctoral mentors and the institutions they represent accountable for socially just mentoring practices. Greater intentionality as well as mandated training informed by the study's results are recommended. HBCU faculty doctoral mentors are challenged to be scholar activists who engage mentoring from an advocacy and accomplice framework. The development of STEM scholar activists is the aspiration of more culturally liberative STEM doctoral mentorships. Black students need mentors who are willing and equipped to be advocates and accomplices in their success.",,0,0,,,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation

Some of the benefits of industrial 3D printing are the feasibility to develop affordable cookie-cut housing, rapid work completion, reduced margin of error, and minimal waste production. With the increase of homelessness and lack of low-income housing in the U.S. and worldwide, there is a pressing need to leverage our technological innovations to serve such communities by offering affordable and sustainable housing equitably. 3D printing is one of those solutions which has the potential to meet the challenging intricate requirements associated with design, materials, sustainability, construction methods, and maintenance/operation. Despite that civil engineering and construction management (CM) curricula do not often integrate 3D printing as a tool to tackle designing and building affordable housing, it is critical to incorporate such emerging technology within the construction curricula to prepare our future workforces. This goal of the study highlights the need for and importance of 3D printing in the construction domain and how it can be used as a valuable tool to construct affordable housing. To achieve this goal, the study pursued twofold approaches: 1) implementing an educational module within undergraduate and graduate courses followed by discussion sessions; and (2) surveying students to capture motivation, interest, team working skills, knowledge acquisition, experiences, and expectations about 3D printing technology. The study utilized box plots and an ordered probit regression model to analyze the obtained data. The results indicate that many CM students lack skills and knowledge in 3D printed building construction technology, but almost 98% of students showed positive interest to learn more about 3D printing technology in a complete course, which currently, if offered in some programs, is optional and part of the elective courses. The ordered probit regression analysis indicates that the implemented module is effective to increase students' interest in 3D printing technological skills. Additionally, the results also demonstrated that students with lower level of skills in robotic machine operation, data preparation, and programming skills as well as those who currently work in the construction industry are more likely to be inclined towards developing skills and knowledge in 3D printing technology.

The new features of MATLAB, such as MATLAB Grader and live scripts, can help students gain not only skills of analysis and design with MATLAB as a tool but also a better understanding of engineering concepts. MATLAB programming exercises are required in homework in a Vibrations course and computer lab projects in a Signals and Systems course. Automated grading with MATLAB Grader provides immediate feedback, which allows students to learn from their own mistakes while they try to pass the multiple requirements for each exercise that the instructor configured in advance. MATLAB live scripts are used in the teaching of Signals and Systems. Students are provided with lab manuals written in live scripts, allowing the integration of formatted text, equations, images, and MATLAB code in a single environment. With the live scripts, the concepts related to the MATLAB programming exercises are reinforced without the need of referring to another document or PowerPoint slides, and the examples embedded in the document can be run section by section with results displayed below the code or in an output window next to the document. Interactive components, such as a slider bar to change the value of time t in the convolution integral procedure and animation of the approximation of a signal using Fourier Series, are included in the examples to further improve the student learning experience. The instructor also used MATLAB live scripts during their lectures. At the end of the semester, the students completed a survey about their experiences with MATLAB Grader and live scripts.

The course includes a final project, where students design, implement, and test a computer vision synchronizing experiment. The goal of the experiment is to observe a clock at two different rates, which must be glitch free, with no skipped values, blurs, or repeats and have minimal drift with millisecond precision as a monotonic process. The gap between basic real-time concepts and more in-depth analysis required to complete a final project is significant. Completion of this project requires hands-on practice with an RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) or embedded Linux while at the same time, learning rate monotonic theory and methods of feasibility analysis. Presently, an introductory exercise is used, along with introduction of practices using trace and profile tools. Students learn multi-core programming and analyze multi-core performance of ARM A-series microprocessors running Linux. Current versions of Linux support fixed priority and dynamic deadline scheduling for predictable response multi-service systems development. This introductory exercise, using synthetic workloads, has led to successful student outcomes for key practice and theory learning objectives, but it is somewhat abstract. The use of synthetic workload executing a series computation gives students experience working with fixed and dynamic priority preemptive scheduling. While students learn to develop Linux POSIX concurrent code, using shared memory threading, they are simultaneously learning rate monotonic theory. The math background and timing analysis experience with diagrams and tools in addition to learning new programming can be demanding. The final project further requires students to make a leap from synthetic workload to computer vision processing. To better bridge this gap, and to separate thread programming from analysis and theory, a simulation workload has been developed and is presented in this paper. The simulation makes use of multiple processor cores, requires asymmetric and symmetric multiprocessing, and adds a problem-based learning and experimental aspect to early exercises. This separation of concerns and early hands-on experimentation is hypothesized to benefit student success for the final project where practice and theory must be combined. The hypothesis is based upon success using simulations to teach undergraduate parallel processing at California State University Chico. Given that many real-time systems today make use of multi-core shared memory parallel processing, the idea to use simulation has become more feasible based upon allocation of cores to real-time services with other cores dedicated to simulation. In this paper, more than a decade of feedback is summarized and critically reviewed based upon the present method of synthetic workload and progression of synthetic workload that leads up to a real-time application. Further, the proposal to augment synthetic workload practices with simulation and to create an improved problem-based learning scaffold for the final project is fully described in detail. The simulation includes dynamic control of single degree of freedom holonomic transportation systems, trains, where simulation is required to execute synchronized with real-time using monotonic sequencing of thread execution. The single degree-of-freedom holonomic simulation has been designed to include displayed plots showing: 1) train speed, 2) train odometry, 3) position on track between stations. The simple physical intuition of the simulation is intended to help students think critically about the consequences of monitoring and to better control service scheduling. The services they must schedule and integrate are: 1) Acceleration/Braking Control, 2) Speed Monitoring, 3) Odometry. They must observe the computation load imparted to a single shared core for these services using “htop” and syslog traces and adjust service rates for optimized control and monitoring of the process with careful consideration of processor loading bounds (rate monotonic and full utility). In all cases deadlines are assumed to be the service period. The actual train dynamic simulation runs on a different core (to avoid interference between the control and monitoring services and the simulation). All code is provided, and students are asked to focus on integration and tuning of the rates and to observe the impact of scheduling method (scheduler type selected from default SCHED_OTHER, reference SCHED_RR, rate monotonic SCHED_FIFO, and dynamic SCHED_DEADLINE). Likewise, they are expected to understand basic utility computation and priority assignment policy for fixed rate monotonic (SCHED_FIFO). The problem introduces student to the use of timestamp tracing (using syslog) and observation of how scheduling mechanism and policy can impact process control. The systems in use all have four or more cores, and simulation starter code will be provided, so students can focus upon real-time service creation and control of simulations running on separate processor cores. The revised approach also features early experimentation with dynamic priorities (Earliest Deadline First with Constant Bandwidth Scheduling - SCHED_DEADLINE) as well as traditional rate monotonic fixed priority (SCHED_FIFO) using Linux. The design for the new exercises using simulation is presented along with the simulation software design and code and will be the basis of an experiment to determine if this problem-based learning approach improves overall student learning outcomes.",,0,0,,,,undefined,

While these types of instruments continue to be used in the industry, there are also new sets of microprocessor-controlled instruments that are increasingly being utilized to make real time flow and energy measurements in real world systems. In addition to focusing on illustrating fundamental concepts related to flow, energy conservation, major and minor losses in pipes and open channels, it is also important to expose students to modern instrumentation methods that they will likely encounter in their practicing careers. Micro-processor based tools also help extend data collection outside traditional laboratory class times allowing students to work with high volume, high frequency (velocity) data. In addition, these processors can be programmed to collect data at different accuracies/precision thus enabling students to understand the veracity of measurements and associated uncertainties. Students also get a first-hand experience of various sensors and concepts related to physical computing (hardware/software integration) that is necessary in modern data collection endeavors. A sequence of micro-processor based sensors and web-based dashboards were introduced into the junior level mechanics of fluids laboratory making use of Arduinos, ESP8266s and Raspberry Pi environments. In particular, the Hall effect sensor for flow measurement, ultrasonic and laser based sensors for depth and hydraulic head measurements, temperature and salinity sensors were integrated to collect data in tandem with conventional hydraulic instruments and conservation principles. Students were exposed to the setup of the sensors and the associated software required to run the sensors. This allowed students to understand the role of indirect measurements (example voltage differences) and the role of calibration in obtaining hydraulic data. The ESP8266 allowed for integration of data with the cloud using ThingSpeak framework to demonstrate wireless sensing capabilities. The precision of measurements were controlled via programming and students were asked to evaluate which instrumentation provided greater precision in an effort to dispel the myth that automatic data acquisition does not necessarily imply accurate data collection. Informal and formal evaluation on the incorporation of micro-processor based sensors indicated students appreciated these additions to the laboratory as it provided them with exposure to modern data collection practices. In addition, the incorporation of these sensors partially overcame modifications to the civil engineering curriculum which resulted in removal of a course on introductory circuits.

The approach uses PBL rather than a traditional lecture and exam to evaluate student learning. Control theory and system identification can be very mathematically heavy. Whether analyzing these systems with Laplace transfers, in State Space or with differential equations in the time domain these problems can be tedious. Not surprisingly, it is often difficult for students to grasp the direct effects of the mathematical methods on controlling the system or plant. In other words, it can be difficult for students to fully grasp how to physically change their system in the same manner that mathematics does. To mediate this source of confusion most control course curriculums include some form of laboratory experiments. More often than not this requires the learning of new software like LabView to drive the control experiments. It also includes other hardware that can be equally expensive. This can leave students dependent on expensive hardware and software to control even the simplest of systems. In this paper we compare two approaches; one with MATLAB and another more direct approach with an Arduino based controller. In both cases the students need either prior knowledge of MATLAB or Arduino programming to complete the experiments. For the see-saw experimental apparatus that we developed, we provide the details and costs associated with making and developing these experiments. We show the contrast between the two experiments using student surveys and provide the results. We also examine the differences between student comprehension as a measure of merit of the two methods. In particular we examine a low-cost 1st order temperature apparatus developed at BYU and then develop a 2nd order see-saw balancer of our own. In both cases these devices cost less than $50.00 to produce and our students were able to build these without much difficulty.

However, the surrounding environment and path for such robots are complex and unstable with unexpected obstacles. Thus, path planning for such robot is crucial to guarantee satisfactory inspection and evaluation while approaching the ideal position. To achieve this goal, we proposed a distributed small-step path planning method using modified reinforcement learning (MRL). Limited distance and 12 directions were gridly refined for the robot to move around. The small moving step ensures the path planning to be optimal in a neighboring safe region. The MRL updates the direction and adjusts the path to avoid unknown disturbances. After finding the best inspection angle, the camera on the robot can capture the picture clearly, thereby improving the detection capability. Furthermore, the corner point detection method of buildings was improved using the Harris algorithm to enhance the detection accuracy. An experimental simulation platform was established to verify the designed robot, path planning method, and overall detection performance. Based on the proposed evaluation index, the post-earthquake building damage was inspected with high accuracy of up to 98%, i.e., 20% higher than traditional unplanned detection.

Such tasks allow students to be more creative and feel ownership over their work, but some students struggle with unstructured tasks and, without proper scaffolds, this can lead to negative learning experiences. Scratch is a widely used coding platform to teach computer science in classrooms and is designed to support learner creativity and expression. With its open-ended nature, Scratch can be used in various ways in the classroom to meet the needs of schools and districts. One challenge of using Scratch in classrooms is supporting learners in exploring their interests and fostering creativity while still meeting the instructional goals of a lesson and ensuring all students are engaged with, and understand, focal concepts and practices. In this paper, we investigate the use of planning sheets to facilitate novice programmers designing and implementing Scratch programs based on open-ended prompts. To evaluate the planning sheets, we look at how closely students' implemented Scratch projects match their plans and whether the implemented Scratch projects met the technical requirements for the given lesson. We analyzed 303 Scratch projects from 155 middle grade students (ages 10-14) who were introduced to programming via the Scratch Encore Curriculum. Completed Scratch projects that used planning sheets (202) were qualitatively coded to evaluate how closely they matched the initial plan, and Scratch programs (303) were analyzed with an automated grader to check if technical project requirements were met. Our results reveal that students that used planning sheets met significantly more technical project requirements and had more complex structures than those that did not have planning sheets. Results differ based on teacher and type of planning sheet used (physical vs. virtual). This work suggests that planning sheets are a helpful tool for young learners when completing open-ended coding projects.",computer science education | K-8 | planning,0,0,,,NSF,1738758,National Science Foundation

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a continuous local search Q-Learning (CLSQL) algorithm to solve these problems and ensure the quality of the planned path. First, the global environment is gradually divided into independent local environments. Then, the intermediate points are searched in each local environment with prior knowledge. After that, the search between each intermediate point is realized to reach the destination point. At last, by comparing other RL-based algorithms, the proposed method improves the convergence speed and computation time while ensuring the optimal path.",complex environment | mobile robot | path planning | prior knowledge | Q-learning,3,1,repositoryvor,Green,NSFC,IPBED11,National Natural Science Foundation of China

The traditional global path planning methods have some shortcomings, such as difficulty in digging into environmental information and finding the optimal path effectively. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a negative gradient differential biogeography-based optimization (NG-DBBO), which has strong local search ability and global optimization ability. Firstly, we present a differential migration approach to increase the population diversity in the iterative process of NG-DBBO, which can realize the information sharing between feature solutions effectively. Then a negative gradient descent strategy based on negative gradient descent is introduced to improve the learning rate, which not only enhances initial global search ability, but also avoids premature convergence. Noteworthily, the convergence of the algorithm is analyzed for single-peak and multi-peak problems respectively. After that, NG-DBBO is combined with the cubic spline interpolation to realize MRPP by the defined coding method and fitness function. The simulation experiments are used to demonstrate the availability of our method, which consist of two parts. In the first part, we select 23 benchmark functions to verify the accuracy and convergence speed of the NG-DBBO algorithm.

These aspects are inspiring today’s emerging biomorphic technologies into both directions, software tools, and hardware systems. Thus, it is worthwhile to investigate into biological processes which enable the brain to perform computations and how they can be modelled and implemented in silicon. Taking inspiration from how the brain performs information processing requires a shift of computational paradigms compared to conventional computer architectures. Indeed, the brain is composed of nervous cells, called neurons, connected with synapses and forming self-organized networks. Neurons and synapses are complex dynamical systems ruled by biochemical and electrical reactions. As a result, they rely on local information forming functional neural clusters. Additionally, neurons communicate with each other with short electrical pulses, called spikes, which travel across synapses. Computational neuroscientists and roboticists attempt to model these computations with spiking neural networks (SNNs) and to ground them with real robots. When implemented on dedicated neuromorphic hardware, spiking neural networks can perform time delay free, energy efficient computations in analogy to the brain. Until recently, the advantages of this technology were limited due to the lack of efficient methods for programming spiking neural networks. Reinforcement learning is one paradigm for programming spiking neural networks, in which neural clusters self-organize them towards functional networks.

However, the learned skills are not easy to generalize to new cases where special constraints such as varying relative distance limitation of robotic end effectors for human-like cooperative manipulations exist. In this paper, we propose a dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) based skills learning framework for redundant dual-arm robots. The method, with a coupling acceleration term to the DMPs function, is inspired by the transient performance control of Barrier Lyapunov Functions. The additional coupling acceleration term is calculated based on the constant joint distance and varying relative distance limitations of end effectors for object-approaching actions. In addition, we integrate the generated actions in joint space and the solution for a redundant dual-arm robot to complete a human-like manipulation.

Background: Human-robot interaction (HRI) is affected by the actual but also expected robot's appearance and capabilities. Multiple factors, such as age, gender, media exposure, ICT exposure, or culture, influence mental models regarding robots; therefore, it is important to investigate those for a specific cohort in the designated geographical area. Research Questions: The mental models regarding robots and programming, and the way they are possibly biased by popular culture, exposure to ICT or parental influence were studied. Research questions concerned cognitive elements of mental models, namely, definitions and knowledge of robots, and programming and how those progress in time. Also, the research studied a figurative aspect of mental models regarding robots, with a focus on anthropomorphic features. Methodology: To research the influence of the short-term HRI, four classes of eight to nine years old elementary school pupils were included in a workshop where pre and postquestionnaires were used as research instruments. Besides pupils, later in this two-phase longitudinal research, after a year of formal education in Informatics, research instruments also included teachers and parents, to investigate their influence on children's mental models. Findings: The change of mental models under the influence of the one-time workshop was not permanent. However, a combination of maturation with informal and formal intervention supports the conceptualization of programming.",Computer science education | educational robots | educational technology | formal and informal learning | human-computer interaction (HCI) | ICT platform | programming | robots | STEM | technology-assisted learning,3,0,,,,undefined,

We formulate the scheduling and path planning problems for the UAV. The goal of the scheduling problem is to find the sequence of nodes that the UAV will visit to complete the data collection task in the shortest possible time, ensuring that it does not run out of energy during its mission. We express this problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem and propose an efficient algorithm to solve the aforementioned NP-hard problem in polynomial time. Path planning problem aims to find a collision-free path for the UAV. While the state-of-the-art schemes have focused on solving the path planning problem in static environments, we study the problem in a dynamic environment with moving obstacles. We develop an algorithm that works on both static and dynamic environments. Our method combines deep reinforcement learning (RL) with graph-based global path planning algorithms to find a collision-free path for the UAV. One important advantage of our RL-based method over the existing studies is its map independency, which allows us to transform the agent's learning from one environment to another. Via simulation studies, we show that our method is significantly effective in improving the safety of the path planning algorithms in dynamic environments.",Deep reinforcement learning (RL) | Internet of Things (IoT) | path planning | unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),6,0,,,,undefined,

To overcome the bottleneck, this article proposes a multimodal transfer-learning-enabled action prediction approach, serving as the prerequisite to ensure the proactive HRCA. First, a multimodal intelligence-based action recognition approach is proposed to predict ongoing human actions by leveraging the visual stream and skeleton stream with short-time input frames. Second, a transfer-learning-enabled model is adapted to transfer learnt knowledge from daily activities to industrial assembly operations rapidly for online operator intention analysis. Third, a dynamic decision-making mechanism, including robotic decision and motion control, is described to allow mobile robots to assist operators in a proactive manner.

MaL algorithms can discover a much lower-dimensional representation (embedding) of a high-dimensional dataset through nonlinear transformations that preserve the most important structure of the original data. State-of-the-art MaL methods directly optimize an embedding without mapping between the original space and the discovered embedded space. This makes interpretability - a key requirement in exploratory data analysis - nearly impossible. Recently, genetic programming has emerged as a very promising approach to MaL by evolving functional mappings from the original space to an embedding. However, genetic programming-based MaL has struggled to match the performance of other approaches. In this work, we propose a new approach to using genetic programming for MaL, which preserves local topology. This is expected to significantly improve performance on tasks where local neighborhood structure (topology) is paramount. We compare our proposed approach with various baseline MaL methods and find that it often outperforms other methods, including a clear improvement over previous genetic programming approaches.

In our initial test, we discovered that children quickly understand the motivation and use of state diagrams using this tool, and will independently discover abstract states even if they are only taught to model using concrete states. To determine whether this approach is appropriate for children of this age we wanted to know: do children understand state diagrams, do they understand the role of reachability, and are they engaged by them? We found that they are able to translate between different representations of state diagrams, strongly indicating that they do understand them.

To test this hypothesis, we split a college computer science orientation class into two sections. One section began programming with a general-purpose language, Python, during week 1. The second section used a new, functional domain-specific teaching language themed around programming simple, well-known physical games. A group of researchers designed the new language with the purpose of giving students a more focused approach to learning basic computer science concepts and emphasizing good programming practices early, such as working with user-defined types and decomposition. Based on student survey responses before and after the two sections and their grades through the two subsequent CS courses, we find that students in the delayed-coding section using the new language had lower engagement in their class.

By analyzing and comparing the current research situation of digital twin technology in the field of coal mine, the framework of digital twin-driven tunneling robot decision control system is designed, including six modules:physical space, virtual space, twin data, planning layer, control layer and execution layer. In this system, the virtual prototype can make planning decisions autonomously and control the synchronous motion of the physical prototype remotely. Firstly, the local obstacle avoidance strategy in unstructured environment is studied based on virtual reality technology. Motion control model and sensor observation model of tunneling robot are established, and obstacles in roadway are reconstructed in virtual environment by laser radar, Ray-Col method is used to detect the collision between robot and obstacle, which lays the foundation for robot path planning decision. Secondly, the global path planning method based on virtual agent is studied by combining deep reinforcement learning technology, the Muti-PPO algorithm based on the improved PPO algorithm is proposed, and the virtual agent of tunneling robot is established through the reward and punishment mechanism, and training in Unity3D platform, The training results show that compared with PPO algorithm and SAC algorithm, the average reward value of Muti - PPO algorithm is increased by 13.82% and 11.31% respectively. Standard deviation decreased by 17.85% and 16.81% respectively; the maximum reward value is increased by 0.14% and 0.43% respectively, and its performance is optimal among the three algorithms. Finally, a decision control platform is built to send the decision instructions generated in the virtual space to the end-effector of the physical prototype, and drive the synchronous change of the virtual prototype through the sensor data of the physical prototype. According to the planning decision, bidirectional mapping and remote control functions of the system, path planning experiment and virtual-real co-movement experiment are designed to verify it. The experimental results of path planning show that the error between the end point of virtual agent path planning and the target point is within 1.2 cm under three different complexity conditions, and the control information can be transmitted to the physical space to control the robot motion remotely. The experimental results show that the virtual prototype and the physical prototype are consistent in the roadway during the operation of the tunneling robot.

Inspired by the morphology of snakes, we propose a path planning algorithm named Swinging Search and Crawling Control, which allows the snake-like redundant manipulators to explore in complex pipeline environments without collision. The proposed algorithm consists of the Swinging Search and the Crawling Control. In Swinging Search, a collision-free manipulator configuration that of the end-effector in the target point is found by applying reinforcement learning to self-motion, instead of designing joint motion. The self-motion narrows the search space to the null space, and the reinforcement learning makes the algorithm use the information of the environment, instead of blindly searching. Then in Crawling Control, the manipulator is controlled to crawl to the target point like a snake along the collision-free configuration. It only needs to search for a collision-free configuration for the manipulator, instead of searching collision-free configurations throughout the process of path planning. Simulation experiments show that the algorithm can complete path planning tasks of hyper-redundant manipulators in complex environments. The 16 degrees of freedom and 24 degrees of freedom manipulators can achieve 83.3% and 96.7% success rates in the pipe, respectively.

Specifically, this strategy repeats the action determined by the agent for a fixed number of frames. It increases computational efficiency by reducing the number of inferences by making the action decision sparse. However, previously, these consecutive changes in frames during the frame-skipping were hidden and ignored from the environment and did not affect the agent's action decision. As a result, it can adversely affect the performance of trained agents, where the performance is more critical than computational efficiency. To alleviate these issues, we propose a new framework that utilizes these hidden frames during the frame-skipping, called $hidden$ $observation$, to enhance the performance of the trained agent. The proposed framework retrieves all hidden observations during frame skipping. It then combines batch inference and an exponentially weighted sum to calculate and merge the outputs from hidden observations.

The particle filter is adopted to estimate the source term under such stochastic noise conditions. The deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is also employed to find the best source search policy in terms of successful estimation and traveled distance. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that the use of the Gaussian mixture model, which clusters the potential source positions from the particle filter, as an input to the DDPG and the gated recurrent unit functioning as a memory in DDPG help to improve the STE performance.

First, the vehicle perception is fully achieved by means of inertial measurement unit (IMU), wheels odometry, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR). In order to compensate the sensors drift to achieve more reliable data and improve the localization estimation and corrections, data fusion between the outputs of wheels odometry, LiDAR, and IMU is made through extended Kalman filter (EKF). Then, TLBO is proposed and applied to determine the optimum online path, where the objectives are to find the shortest path to reach the target destination, and to maximize the path smoothness, while avoiding the surrounding obstacles, and taking into account the vehicle dynamic and algebraic constraints. To check the performance of the proposed TLBO algorithm, it is compared in simulation to genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and a hybrid GA–PSO algorithm.

Early works relied on simplified dynamics or polynomial trajectory representations that did not exploit the full actuator potential of the quadrotor, and, thus, resulted in suboptimal solutions. Recent works can plan minimum-time trajectories; yet, the trajectories are executed with control methods that do not account for obstacles. Thus, a successful execution of such trajectories is prone to errors due to model mismatch and in-flight disturbances. To this end, we leverage deep reinforcement learning and classical topological path planning to train robust neural-network controllers for minimum-time quadrotor flight in cluttered environments.

More importantly, the learned policy solves the planning and control problem simultaneously online to account for disturbances, thus achieving much higher robustness.

Finally, the future development direction of key technologies of coal mine robots is prospected from 3 aspects; perception and cognition, planning and decision and system integration. The development trend of perception and cognition not only requires coal mine robots to have perception capabilities, but also requires robots to complete cognitive learning based on a small amount of available information outside of regular events. The key challenge is to develop multi-sensor fusion technology and few-shot learning methods. The development direction of planning and decision can be divided into single-target planning and multi-target decision-making. Coal mine robots use perception and cognitive information to achieve point-to-point path planning and obstacle avoidance, and complete multi-task optimization according to work requirements. Thereby, the working efficiency of coal mine robots can be improved. The development of robot collaboration systems and communication interactive systems is the main challenge for system integration. Through a complete internal and external network system, real-time and closed-loop interaction among coal mine managers, technical workers and robot equipment and cooperation between multi-number/multi-type of coal mine robots will be completed.",coal mine robot | environment perception | machine learning | optimized control | path planning,7,0,,,,undefined,

To collect the data, the completion of four different questionnaires, for every annual event, was asked separately, by the participants and the organizers. The paper provides empirical insights on setting up an educational competition. It also outlines the characteristics of the students taking part and underlines the results that the contents have on them. It suggests that teamwork and collaboration within the team is a prerequisite for a competition to have an impact on the educational process. Furthermore, robotic competitions raise the interest of students in robotics, programming, and STEM, while they develop social skills and create bonds between the participants.

Remarkable performance has been achieved by the deep recognition models in the past decade. As far as we know, however, these deep architectures are incapable of explicitly encoding the human visual perception, that is, the sequence of gaze movements and the subsequent cognitive processes. In this article, a biologically inspired deep model is proposed for scene classification, where the human gaze behaviors are robustly discovered and represented by a unified deep active learning (UDAL) framework. More specifically, to characterize objects' components with varied sizes, an objectness measure is employed to decompose each scenery into a set of semantically aware object patches. To represent each region at a low level, a local-global feature fusion scheme is developed which optimally integrates multimodal features by automatically calculating each feature's weight. To mimic the human visual perception of various sceneries, we develop the UDAL that hierarchically represents the human gaze behavior by recognizing semantically important regions within the scenery. Importantly, UDAL combines the semantically salient region detection and the deep gaze shifting path (GSP) representation learning into a principled framework, where only the partial semantic tags are required. Meanwhile, by incorporating the sparsity penalty, the contaminated/redundant low-level regional features can be intelligently avoided. Finally, the learned deep GSP features from the entire scene images are integrated to form an image kernel machine, which is subsequently fed into a kernel SVM to classify different sceneries. Experimental evaluations on six well-known scenery sets (including remote sensing images) have shown the competitiveness of our approach.",Active learning | bioinspired | contaminated | gaze behavior | machine learning | multimodal | remote sensing,3,0,,,,undefined,

As such, undergraduate and graduate curricula are beginning to regularly incorporate scientific programing in the classroom. However, there are several key challenges to successfully incorporating scientific programming into a hydrology course or curriculum, such as meeting disciplinary outcomes alongside teaching students to code, equity issues with access to computing power, and effective classroom management. While these challenges were exacerbated by the global pandemic, shifting to online and hybrid learning formats provided an opportunity to explore and re-evaluate the way we facilitated our hydrology courses and integrated coding exercises and learning. In this article, we reflect on these experiences in three very different hydrology courses (e.g., courses housed in geoscience/engineering, environmental science, and biology programs) with an eye toward identifying successes and opportunities for improvement. We explore this by presenting ten best management practices (BMPs), representing a series of recommendations we have for teaching a virtual, hybrid, or in-person hydrology course that incorporates coding. While all recommendations provided can be applied to many programming languages, the focus of the paper (given the expertise of the authors) is on R. Our BMPs focus on technological facilitation, managing the virtual classroom, and instructional resources, with lessons learned that are applicable to in-person instruction. We also summarize the ways that the authors of this article integrate coding into our coursework to serve as a framework for prepping new courses or those revising existing hydrologic coursework. Above all, we hope these series of recommendations will evolve as hydrology courses continue to emphasize computational skills alongside disciplinary learning.",coding education | computational thinking | hydrogeology | hydrology | STEM education and learning,2,1,repositoryvor,Green,SU,undefined,Syracuse University

Recent literature has pointed out the value of children acquiring computational thinking skills (i.e., understanding and applying concepts, such as conditionals, iteration, or generalization), especially while learning STEM subjects. Robotics has been used as a tool to introduce computational thinking and STEM knowledge to children. As physical objects, robots have been proposed as developmentally appropriate for the early childhood setting, promoting motivation and allowing young learners to represent abstract ideas in a concrete setting. This study presents a novel educational robotics (ER) intervention using RoboTito, a robot programmable through tangible elements in its environment designed for kindergarteners. We used a quasi-experimental design with an active control group. In addition, we conducted a structured observation of the filmed material of the sessions to gather data on children’s attention and motivation throughout the activities. Fifty-one children (male = 33; mean age = 66 months, SD = 5.49 months) attending level 5 (kindergarten) at a Uruguayan public school participated in the study. Children in our experimental condition participated in an intervention programming RoboTito using tangible elements, while children in our control condition played with the robot through sensory-motor activities using a remote control and did not engage in programming. Motivational and attentional factors were assessed through video-recorded sessions of the ER activities. Four trained observers blind to the experimental conditions participated in the coding. Children’s interactions were assessed in four categories: task engagement, distractibility, oral participation, and objective fulfillment. Our results suggest children’s task engagement mediated their gains in CT after the intervention; post-hoc Tukey contrasts revealed non-significant pre-test to post-test gains for the control and low engagement groups, and significant for the high engagement group. Overall, we conclude task engagement played a central role in children’s learning gains and our robotics intervention was successful in promoting CT for engaged children.

Teachers’ endeavours to conduct their courses online, the support they take during their endeavours, and their relationships with such basic components as the environment, content and students during this adaptation process will be revealed within the framework of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a sequential transformative mixed model was used in which firstly quantitative and then qualitative data were collected and analysed. The sample of this study consists of 307 ICT teachers employed and serving at public and private school in 2020–21. A proper sampling technique is used in the study. In this study, a sequential transformative mixed model was used in which firstly quantitative and then qualitative data were collected and analysed (Creswell, 2009). The sample of this study consists of 307 ICT teachers employed and serving at public and private school in 2020–21. A proper sampling technique is used in the study. Findings: The ICT teachers’ adaptations to the online courses have developed positively over the sub-dimensions of UTAUT, which are performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SE), facilitating conditions (FC) and behavioural intention (BI). The ICT teachers’ adaptations to the online instruction process have a significant effect on PE, FC and BI on the basis of gender, and on PE and EE on the basis of course content quality. In the process whereby the ICT teachers carry out the ITS course online, the sub-dimensions of PE, SE and FC are significantly predictive of the BI. Research limitations/implications: UTAUT has been taken as a guiding framework in explaining and discussing the adaptations. Similarly, in other studies focussing on adaptation, this model could be employed in planning the research process. In addition, this study has followed a method in which qualitative data are mostly used to explain the quantitative data. Further studies may adopt a process whereby qualitative data are largely used to describe the way ITS course is conducted in online environments and this process may be used to develop a model. Practical implications: Examining the students’ BIs in online courses overlaps with the sub-dimension of PE in this study, which stresses that PE, EE and motivation are significantly and directly effective on the students’ intentions of using the online courses, while there is a difference between these two studies in terms of the dimension of EE. The factors such learning outcome, curriculum, attendance to the course, use of materials and tools, interaction and technological substructure appear to be affected by this dimension, so they could be taken as important in that they reveal the importance of the study. Originality/value: This study may provide clues for the online instruction practices that it reveals teachers’ adaptations to online learning environments at secondary schools. On the other hand, software, hardware, coding and robotics take place in the subjects like product designing, developing and programming that are within the content of ITS course for secondary schools. Even though there is a curriculum prepared for these subjects, a lot of different instruction techniques can be used for the teaching of these subjects. This can allow some inferences about the environments and methods suitable for the online instruction of the related subjects.",ICT teachers | Information technologies and software course | Online instruction | Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology,2,0,,,,undefined,

Such a path planning often needs to be done base only on a given environment that is unknown to the Agent at the beginning, and an effective reinforcement learning is required. Smoothed-shortcut Q-learning (SSQL) Algorithm is presented that enable the Agent to learn and then figure out a smoothed short-cut path to the final goal that is initially unknown to the Agent in a given environment. The SSQL is proposed to solve practical problems for mobile robots effectively arrive at its goal in a strange environment, with a path that is a smooth and continuous curve of shortest distance. The SSQL algorithm consists three major ingredients. First, a virtual rectangular environment boundary of the environment is constructed, based on the pre-explored information. The Q values of guidance point for the virtual rectangular environment are increased to improve the learning efficiency of the Agent. Second, the path found by the Agent at the current time is then optimized by finding short-cuts along the path to eliminate the possible redundant paths and reduce the zig-zag segments, minimizing the total distance between the starting and target point. Third, at the turning positions on the path, the Bezier curve is used to further smooth the path, so as to improve the dynamics for the movement of the robot agent. The final path generated by our SSQL algorithm will be optimal in terms of fast convergence, smoothness and shortest distance. The SSQL algorithm is tested by comparison with the standard Q-Learning algorithm in different environments with various obstacle densities and learning rate. The results show that our SSQL algorithm has indeed achieved fast convergence, short and smooth paths, and with few turning points.",Bezier curve | jump point optimization | mobile robot | Q value of the guidance | Q-Learning | smooth path,1,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,

BDE includes the most essential and novel developments of Computational Thinking (CT), which are fundamentally responsible for nurturing students' problem-solving skills. Thus, evaluating teaching materials, scaffolding guidelines, and assessments is becoming increasingly important for the successful implementation of CT in Austrian classrooms. This study is a part of a longitudinal multi-cycle educational design research project aiming to explore how to foster CT and to raise the awareness, importance, and confidence of teachers and students in applying CT for everyday uses. Our paper focuses on a sub-study in which teaching units for grade 3 and 4 students (8–10 years) were designed by combining an Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook and Physical Computing with the micro:bit device. The designed learning environment consists of three units and was implemented in two classes over 3 weeks. The two classes were further split into two groups each, to ensure better support during implementation. The class teachers received upfront teacher training and conducted pre- and post-test assessments with the students. The resulting data was then analyzed to gain insights into the effects on CT skills of the young learners. Results showed that combining block-based programming and physical computing devices could become a promising approach to promote computational thinking skills in lower school grades. Furthermore, the observed direction of the designed units supports low-barrier access to increase the desired uses of CT in classrooms.",assessment | block-based programming | computational thinking | computer science | integrated learning environment | microbit | physical computing | primary digital education,4,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

In particular, the recently proposed activity-based view on access and usage control provides a promising approach to bridge the gap between these two perspectives. We argue that humanoid robots provide for specific challenges due to their task-universality and their use in both, private and public spaces. Furthermore, they are socially connected to various parties and require policy creation at runtime due to learning. We contribute first attempts on the architecture and enforcement layer as well as on joint modeling, and discuss challenges and a research roadmap also for the policy and objectives layer.

Their independent positioning plays a key role for completing assigned tasks in a complex environment. However, positioning based on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) may result in GNSS jamming and quadruped robots not operating properly in environments sheltered by buildings. In this paper, a tightly coupled LiDAR vision inertial odometer (LVIO) is proposed to address the positioning inaccuracy of quadruped robots, which have poor mileage information obtained though legs and feet structures only. With this optimization method, the point cloud data obtained by 3D LiDAR, the image feature information obtained by binocular vision, and the IMU inertial data are combined to improve the precise indoor and outdoor positioning of a quadruped robot. This method reduces the errors caused by the uniform motion model in laser odometer as well as the image blur caused by rapid movements of the robot, which can lead to error-matching in a dynamic scene; at the same time, it alleviates the impact of drift on inertial measurements. Finally, the quadruped robot in the laboratory is used to build a physical platform for verification. The experimental results show that the designed LVIO effectively realizes the positioning of four groups of robots with high precision and strong robustness, both indoors or outdoors, which verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.",lidar visual inertial odometer | positioning of quadruped robot | tightly coupled nonlinear optimization,1,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,NSFC,20KJA510007,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Their performance is highly dependent on the volume, the velocity, and the structure of the data. They are used in many different domains (from small, embedded devices, to large-scale, high-performance computing systems) but in all cases they need to provide answers with very low latency to enable real-time decision making and autonomy. Coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs), i.e., architectures composed of functional units able to perform complex operations interconnected through a network-on-chip and configure the datapath to map complex kernels, are a promising platform to accelerate these applications thanks to their adaptability. They provide higher flexibility than application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) while offering increased energy efficiency and faster reconfiguration speed with respect to field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). However, designing and specializing CGRAs requires significant efforts. The inherent flexibility of these devices makes the application mapping process equally important to the hardware design generation. To obtain efficient systems, approaches that simultaneously considers software and hardware optimizations are necessary.

Reactive control systems are often safety-critical and associated with real-time execution requirements, a domain of predilection for synchronous programming languages. Extending the high levels of assurance found in reactive control systems to computationally intensive code remains an open issue. We tackle it by unifying concepts and algorithms from synchronous languages with abstractions commonly found in general-purpose and ML compilers. This unification across embedded and high-performance computing enables a high degree of reuse of compiler abstractions and code. We first recall commonalities between dataflow synchronous languages and the static single assignment (SSA) form of general-purpose/ML compilers. We highlight the key mechanisms of synchronous languages that SSA does not cover-denotational concepts such as synchronizing computations with an external time base, cyclic and reactive I/O, as well as the operational notions of relaxing control flow dominance and the modeling of absent values. We discover that initialization-related static analyses and code generation aspects can be fully decoupled from other aspects of synchronous semantics such as memory management and causality analysis, the latter being covered by existing dominance-based algorithms of SSA-form compilers. We show how the SSA form can be seamlessly extended to enable all SSA-based transformations and optimizations on reactive programs with synchronous concurrency. We derive a compilation flow suitable for both high-performance and reactive aspects of a control application, by embedding the Lustre dataflow synchronous language into the SSA-based MLIR/LLVM compiler infrastructure. This allows the modeling of signal processing and deep neural network inference in the (closed) loop of feedback-directed control systems. With only minor efforts leveraging the MLIR infrastructure, the generated code matches or outperforms state-of-the-art synchronous language compilers on computationally intensive ML applications.",lustre | machine learning (ML) | MLIR | reactive programming | SSA,0,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,

An issue within computer science education, however, is that large introductory programming courses often involve little opportunity for creative thinking within coursework. The undergraduate introductory programming course (CS1) is notorious for its poor student performance and retention rates across multiple institutions. Integrating opportunities for creative thinking may help combat this issue by adding a personal touch to course content, which could allow beginner CS students to better relate to the abstract world of programming. Research on the role of creativity in computer science education (CSE) is an interesting area with a lot of room for exploration due to the complexity of the phenomenon of creativity as well as the CSE research field being fairly new compared to some other education fields where this topic has been more closely explored.To contribute to this area of research, this article provides a literature review exploring the concept of creativity as relevant to computer science education and CS1 in particular. Based on the review of the literature, we conclude creativity is an essential component to computer science, and the type of creativity that computer science requires is in fact, a teachable skill through the use of various tools and strategies. These strategies include the integration of open-ended assignments, large collaborative projects, learning by teaching, multimedia projects, small creative computational exercises, game development projects, digitally produced art, robotics, digital story-telling, music manipulation, and project-based learning. Research on each of these strategies and their effects on student experiences within CS1 is discussed in this review. Last, six main components of creativity-enhancing activities are identified based on the studies about incorporating creativity into CS1. These components are as follows: Collaboration, Relevance, Autonomy, Ownership, Hands-On Learning, and Visual Feedback. The purpose of this article is to contribute to computer science educators' understanding of how creativity is best understood in the context of computer science education and explore practical applications of creativity theory in CS1 classrooms. This is an important collection of information for restructuring aspects of future introductory programming courses in creative, innovative ways that benefit student learning.",Creativity | Literature review,4,0,,,,undefined,

We present a compiler that reads CNNs from native frameworks (i.e., MXNet, Caffe, Keras, and Tensorflow), optimizes them, generates codes, and provides performance estimates. The compiler combines quantization information from the native environment and optimizations to feed the runtime with code as efficient as any hardware expert could write.

The reasons are that automatic speech recognition of non-native conversational speech is considered to be unreliable and that the dialogue management task of selecting robot utterances that are adequate at a given turn is complex in social conversations. This study therefore investigates if robot-led conversation practice in a second language with pairs of adult learners could potentially be managed by an autonomous robot. We first investigate how correct and understandable transcriptions of second language learner utterances are when made by a state-of-the-art speech recogniser. We find both a relatively high word error rate (41%) and that a substantial share (42%) of the utterances are judged to be incomprehensible or only partially understandable by a human reader. We then evaluate how adequate the robot utterance selection is, when performed manually based on the speech recognition transcriptions or autonomously using (a) predefined sequences of robot utterances, (b) a general state-of-the-art language model that selects utterances based on learner input or the preceding robot utterance, or (c) a custom-made statistical method that is trained on observations of the wizard’s choices in previous conversations. It is shown that adequate or at least acceptable robot utterances are selected by the human wizard in most cases (96%), even though the ASR transcriptions have a high word error rate. Further, the custom-made statistical method performs as well as manual selection of robot utterances based on ASR transcriptions. It was also found that the interaction strategy that the robot employed, which differed regarding how much the robot maintained the initiative in the conversation and if the focus of the conversation was on the robot or the learners, had marginal effects on the word error rate and understandability of the transcriptions but larger effects on the adequateness of the utterance selection.

A new method to build the initial population is proposed to find the initial population regardless of the number and location of obstacles in the environment. Q-Learning is implemented as a local search function of the BA. The hybridization of the BA and the Q-Learning aims to find the optimal path with a fewer number of iterations of the BA. This method takes advantage of the BA to solve the problem without constraints and the sterilization in the Q-Learning to find the shortest path. The experiment is run on some different maps to validate the proposed method in the static and dynamic case. The experimental results show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method in finding the optimal path.

Given the map information, our CGAN model can generate an efficient probability distribution of feasible paths, which can be utilized by the CGAN-RRT∗ algorithm to find an optimal path with a nonuniform sampling strategy. The CGAN model is trained by learning from ground-truth maps, each of which is generated by putting all the results of executing the RRT algorithm 50 times on one raw map.

Rather, it must provide students with interactive learning to support their target-language (TL) interaction while reducing potential TL anxiety. This study aimed to validate the effects of the proposed method of pair programming (PP) along with question-and-response interaction in a board-game activity on young learners’ CT skills and TL learning across contexts. Two Grade 6 classes, one with 15 students who were studying Chinese as a Second Language (CSL) and the other with 15 students who were studying English as a Foreign Language (EFL), participated in the activity. A series of instruments on achievement assessment, questionnaires on CT skills and TL anxiety, and sequential learning behaviour analysis were used to critically examine the results. The main conclusion is that the EFL group showed better social skills of cooperation on CT and lower TL learning anxiety, while the CSL group demonstrated better problem-solving skills in CT, but presented more behaviours of trial-and-error loops.

Programming and robotics software such as Scratch, Lego Mindstorms, M-Bot, Arduino and Bee-Bot are tools with a block-based coding interface. While there was no consensus on the scope and measurement of CT, CT was generally studied within the framework of abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, and debugging sub-skills. CT developments were measured through scales and tests consisting mostly of multiple-choice and open-ended questions. The research focused on primary and secondary school students while it was limited on preschool level. In addition, studies stating that gender is an effective factor in the development of CT in different age groups are in the majority.

In this article, we present state-of-the-art DRL-based collision-avoidance trajectory planning for uncertain environments such as a safe human coexistent environment. Since the robot manipulator operates in high dimensional continuous state-action spaces, model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic (SAC), and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) framework are adapted to our scenario for comparison. In order to assess our proposal, we simulate a 7-DOF Panda (Franka Emika) robot manipulator in the PyBullet physics engine and then evaluate its trajectory planning with reward, loss, safe rate, and accuracy.

Simultaneously, the remarkable increase in the number of embedded systems in electric vehicles (EVs) has led to the search for new optimized state of charge (SOC) estimation strategies suitable for implementation on small and limited MCUs. In this regard, this paper provides a design and quantization processes of the 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN) and the GRU-recurrent neural network (GRU-RNN), devoted for SOC estimation. Both the NN algorithms are designed and trained using data collected from an 18650 Li-ion battery. Furthermore, to account for the limited computational resources of the EV MCUs, the pre-trained models are then converted into highly optimized C-codes using the latest model quantification techniques. In this regard, this paper investigates, the performances of the STM32Cube.AI and the TensorFlow Lite for microcontroller (TFLite Micro), in quantizing the activation functions and weights of the proposed NN models. This is achieved by converting these latter from 32-bits floating-point to 8-bit integer precision. The obtained experimental results, under different profiles, indicate that the 1D CNN is more accurate than the GRU-based model with root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.33% and mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.62%. Furthermore, the impact of the quantization using STM32Cube.AI is compared with that using the TFLite Micro. The obtained results, demonstrated the superiority of the 1D CNN model quantized using the STM32Cube.AI. This latter reduces the flash memory size of the 1D CNN model from 10.82 to 2.89 KB and the RAM size from 2.49 to 1.04 KB, compared to the TFLite Micro, which reduces the RAM size from 7.0107 to 4.23 KB, and the flash from 43.361 to 15.88 KB.",1D CNN | data-driven | GRU neural network | lithium-ion battery | machine learning | quantization | state of charge,12,0,,,,undefined,

The problem addresses the computation of a collision-free optimal path from a predefined initial position to target position during transportation of stick or object cooperatively by robot pair in the multi-robot environment. The stick carrying application has been resolved by embedding the modified Q-learning into the hybrid process of an improved version of particle swarm optimization and intelligent water drop algorithm. In the present context, modified Q-learning generates the best solution for particle swarm optimization and particle swarm optimization is upgraded through the perception of cubic spline and generate the optimal position in the successive iteration using intelligent water drop algorithm and also enhances the intensification and diversification capability of particle swarm optimization. The proposed hybrid algorithm computes the collision-free subsequent position for each robot pair by avoiding the obstacles in its path, avoiding the trapping at the local optima, improving the convergence speed, optimizing the path distance for every pair of robots, energy usage and path smoothness both in the static and dynamic environment's.

ROP is one of the most dangerous security exploits because, if wittingly crafted, it can be used to wreak havoc on the system, network, and nodes connected to it. It is not surprising that ROP has been studied on architectures such as x86 and ARM, mostly with an operating system (OS). Xtensa is one of the most popular industry standards for digital signal processors and it is present in many resource-constrained firmware-based embedded WiFi home automation devices, which operate by reading instructions directly from flash memory. Despite leveraging no real OS, Xtensa is not immune to ROP, and there have been reports of buffer overflow vulnerability exploitations leading to ROP in Xtensa. Therefore, we present the first detection of ROP, and its variant Jump-oriented programming (JOP), in a firmware-only environment using hardware performance counters (HPCs). Our approach discerns the variations in the HPC micro-architectural events triggered by ROP attacks and benign program execution. We implemented attack scenarios using instrumented programs and exploits that perform tasks similar to those in a known microprocessor benchmark programs. We recorded micro-architectural events to train a machine learning binary classifier. The learned model identifies relevant HPCs, which could serve as predictors of ROP/JOP execution even in embedded firmware-only configurations, where features atypical to conventional processors, like instruction memory and data memory, are available.

Several persistent myths reinforce this focus. These myths express an idealized model of software and software development.

Writing new code is dominated by composition of ill-specified software and non-software components. General-purpose languages may be less appropriate for a task than domain-specific languages, and functional correctness is often a less appropriate goal than overall fitness for task. Support for programming to meet a specification is of little help to people who are programming in order to understand their problems. Reasoning about software is challenged by uncertainty and nondeterminism in the execution environment and by the increasingly dominant role of data, especially with the advent of systems that rely on machine learning.

The shape of the human body and bed is complex which may lead to the collision between the human and the robot. Because the sparse reward the robot obtains from the environment may not support the robot to accomplish the task, a neural network is trained to control the manipulators of the robot to prepare to hold the patient up by using a proximal policy optimization algorithm with a continuous reward function. Firstly, considering the realistic scene, the 3D simulation environment is built to conduct the research. Secondly, inspired by the idea of the artificial potential field, a new reward and punishment function was proposed to help the robot obtain enough rewards to explore the environment. The function is consisting of four parts which include the reward guidance function, collision detection, obstacle avoidance function, and time function. Where the reward guidance function is used to guide the robot to approach the targets to hold the patient, the collision detection and obstacle avoidance function are complementary to each other and are used to avoid obstacles, and the time function is used to reduce the number of training episode. Finally, after the robot is trained to reach the targets, the training results are analyzed. Compared with the DDPG algorithm, the PPO algorithm reduces about 4 million steps for training to converge. Moreover, compared with the other reward and punishment functions, the function used in this paper will obtain many more rewards at the same training time. Apart from that, it will take much less time to converge, and the episode length will be shorter; so, the advantage of the algorithm used in this paper is verified.",complex environment | deep reinforcement learning | dual-arm robot | reward | trajectory planning,3,1,repositoryvor,Green,NSFC,11372073,National Natural Science Foundation of China

In these conditions, pupils use Lego EV-3 robots and Mindstorms software to solve programming problems. As a post-measurement, a Lego challenge is applied. In this article, it is shown that the integration of a dynamic task design to solve a programming problem is essential for a deeper understanding of CT skills. Furthermore, when pupils can immediately test the consequences of their program in a dynamic environment and, thus, the learning environment provides an appropriate problem, they gain a deeper understanding of the added value of sensors and will be better able to reason about complex problems. It is found that programming in a dynamic problem environment almost naturally evokes SRA-thinking, as opposed to programming in a static environment. The influence of SRA-programming as demonstrated identifies characteristics of CT.",Computational thinking (CT) | dynamic environments | robotics | sense-reason-act (SRA)-thinking | tangible output,2,0,repositoryvor,Green,,NWO/Subsidie KIEM.21V01.051,

Safe and efficient navigation in such environments requires a precise motion model of an AUV. However, the motion of an AUV is difficult to be accurately predicted due to its nonlinear dynamics significantly affected by its surrounding fluids. To resolve this difficulty, we propose to use a Bayes Adaptive Markov Decision Process (BA-MDP) for robust decision making, which is able to hedge against errors in the AUV's motion model through online learning. To construct the BA-MDP accurately, a Clustering Guided Explorative Tree (CGETree) is proposed to explore all the possible connectivities within the AUV's state space in an offline manner. The CGETree's nodes are clustered together to provide a discretization of the state space, and the tree edges, after being combined with a discrete noise model, provide a physics-based-prior for the transition model, which will be updated online along with the robot's movement.

To accomplish the task, it requires a high-level path planner to generate a sequence of cable configurations from the initial state to the target state and a low-level manipulation planner to plan the robot motion commands to transit between adjacent states. However, there are yet no proper representations to model the cable with the environment objects, impeding the design of both high-level path planning and low-level manipulation planning. In this letter, we propose a framework for cable routing with spatial representation. For high-level planning, by considering the spatial relations between the cable and the environment objects such as fixtures, the proposed method is able to plan a path from the initial state to the goal state in a graph. For low-level manipulation, multiple manipulation primitives are efficiently learned from human demonstration, to configure the cable to planned intermediate states leveraging the same spatial representation. We also implement a cable state estimator that robustly extracts the spatial representation from raw RGB-D images, thus completing the cable routing framework.

The matching between visual information supply and information demand from the agronomical technic is the key power to promote the picking robot from the laboratory to the field. The three-dimensional pose information, containing the location of each organ of the plant, can meet the demand of agronomical technic. It is the premise of precisely handling the cluster of fruits. In order to realize the fine tomato bunch harvesting operation in a bunch, this paper proposed a three-dimensional pose detection method for tomato bunch. The method, named Tomato Pose Method (TPM), is composed of a priori geometric model, a cascaded multi-task network, and a three-dimensional reconstruction process. Based on prior knowledge and agronomic technology, this prior geometric model comprehensively and flexibly describes the spatial location information of tomato bunch. The cascaded multi-task network is designed based on hourglass structure and transfer learning, which is suitable for bounding box and key point prediction of tomato bunches in complex environments. Finally, combining the prior geometric model and the spatial position information of each key point, the tomato bunch is reconstructed. Only a medium training dataset, containing 1800 RGBD images covering changing lighting, occlusion, and various poses, is needed for training. Its success rate of TPM on two-dimensional keypoint detection is 94.02%, the accuracy of 85.77% predicted points are at medium level. And 70.05% tomato bunch with multi-pose can be constructed. More importantly, this method only needs one RGBD image taken by a commercial camera to realize the three-dimensional reconstruction of a single-bunch scenario in 1.0 s, and a multi-bunch scenario in 2.0 s. It provides comprehensive information, and provides data basis for target positioning and path planning of picking robot, which makes the non-destructive harvesting possible.",Deep learning | Harvesting robot | Hourglass structure | Keypoints detection | Tomato bunch,9,0,,,MOST,CN 2016YFD0701,Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China

The problem addresses the stick transportation by robot pairs from the predefined starting position to the pre-assumed goal position. This paper describes the method of computing collision-free paths for multiple numbers of paired robots called twins using a hybrid algorithm with balanced local exploitation and global exploration. The hybrid algorithm is designed by combining the individual benefits of the improved Q-Learning (IQ) and democratic robotics particle swarm optimization (DRPSO). The main intention of IQ is to produce the best position with collision avoidance by executing the best state-action pair. DRPSO algorithm computes the optimal trajectory for the twin robot using the distributed democratic approach and enhances the intensification capability. The twin robots are synchronized to the number of steps, turns, the direction of movement, and distance between both of them in the proposed approach. Computer simulation results reveal the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in both paths travelled and runtime. The experimental and VREP simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm offers better synchronization, cooperation, and performance in terms of several parameters such as path length, path deviation, run time, and path smoothness as a replica of the number of turns made. The comparative study with artificial bee colony optimization (ABCO) and imperialist competitive firefly algorithm (ICFA) witnesses the superiority of the hybrid IQ-DRPSO algorithm.

To achieve this, we first propose the environment guide vector that humans can intuitively interpret. We then propose a novel image-to-image translation network that translates a given image towards the environment described by the vector. Accordingly, it aims to synthesize a new image that has the same content as the given image while looking like captured in the provided environment by the environment guide vector.

Existing approaches for competence-aware planning are either model-based, requiring explicit enumeration of known failure sources, or purely statistical, using state- and location-specific failure statistics to infer competence. We instead propose a structured model-free approach to competence-aware planning by reasoning about plan execution failures due to errors in perception, without requiring a priori enumeration of failure sources or requiring location-specific failure statistics. We introduce competence-aware path planning via introspective perception (CPIP), a Bayesian framework to iteratively learn and exploit task-level competence in novel deployment environments. CPIP factorizes the competence-aware planning problem into two components. First, perception errors are learned in a model-free and location-agnostic setting via introspective perception prior to deployment in novel environments. Second, during actual deployments, the prediction of task-level failures is learned in a context-aware setting. Experiments in a simulation show that the proposed CPIP approach outperforms the frequentist baseline in multiple mobile robot tasks, and is further validated via real robot experiments in environments with perceptually challenging obstacles and terrain.",failure detection and recovery | Motion and path planning | visual learning,3,0,repositoryam,Green,NSF,CAREER-2046955,National Science Foundation

We propose a framework based on a state-transition system formalism that abstracts the problem by removing unnecessary details and, hence, considerably reduces planning space complexity. Forward search from an initial state allows the robot to find a sequence of actions to accomplish the assigned task.

In this work, we propose to train the model with a purely intrinsic reward signal to guide exploration, which is based on the impact of the robot's actions on its internal representation of the environment. So far, impact-based rewards have been employed for simple tasks and in procedurally generated synthetic environments with countable states. Since the number of states observable by the agent in realistic indoor environments is non-countable, we include a neural-based density model and replace the traditional count-based regularization with an estimated pseudo-count of previously visited states. The proposed exploration approach outperforms DRL-based competitors relying on intrinsic rewards and surpasses the agents trained with a dense extrinsic reward computed with the environment layouts.

The present study thus addresses this challenge. Guidance and feedback were considered as critical intervention methods to foster CT competences in ER settings. A between-subjects experiment was conducted with 66 students aged 8 to 9 in the context of a remote collaborative robot programming mission, with four experimental conditions. A two-step strategy was employed to report students' CT competence (their performance and learning process). Firstly, the students' CT learning gains were measured through a pre-post-test design. Secondly, video analysis was used to identify the creative computational problem-solving patterns involved in the experimental condition that had the most favourable impact on the students’ CT scores. Results show that delayed feedback is an effective intervention method for CT development in ER activities.

Lacking prior knowledge, next-best-view (NBV) methods are typically used to plan a view sequence, with the goal of covering as many object surface areas as possible in an unknown environment. However, such methods have two problems: (1) they are unable to perform global path planning; and (2) the reconstruction process is inefficient because of time-consuming ray casting and high movement cost. We propose a neural network, SCVP, to pre-learn prior knowledge via set covering (SC) based training so as to achieve one-shot view planning. The SCVP network takes the volumetric occupancy grid as input and directly predicts a small (ideally minimum) number of views that cover all surface areas. Given object 3D models as a priori geometric knowledge, the training dataset is automatically labeled by the set covering optimization method. We propose a global path planning method to reconstruct objects without redundant movement. Comparative experiments on multiple datasets of 3D models show that, under the condition of similar or better surface coverage, the proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art NBV methods in terms of movement cost and inference time.

It is not only impractical but also leads to redundant information that could even impair the multi-agent cooperation. A succinct communication scheme should learn which information is relevant and influential to each agent's decision making process. To address this problem, we consider a request-reply scenario and propose Decision Causal Communication (DCC), a simple yet efficient model to enable agents to select neighbors to conduct communication during both training and execution. Specifically, a neighbor is determined as relevant and influential only when the presence of this neighbor causes the decision adjustment on the central agent. This judgment is learned only based on agent's local observation and thus suitable for decentralized execution to handle large scale problems.

The research developed in a qualitative methodology manner; the data used for this article were collected through the solving of five robotic problems and an open-ended question that had to be answered by each of the 25 participants individually. The results showed that, in general, the most frequent error appeared in problems in which movements were set in a Euclidean space of two dimensions. That is to say, the problems’ solving required a selection of different commands: turn, moving forward and/or backwards.

For this purpose, a new human–robot interface, in which industrial robots can be controlled by hand movements, has been created. In this interface, Leap Motion Controller (LMC), which uses an IR Camera for the control of robot arm positioning and motion trajectories, and Myo armband, which detects wrist and hand movements with EMG sensors, is used to control of robot end effector (tool) actions.

During robot positioning, LIDAR and cameras are often used to collect environmental data. Through calculations, structural or texture features in the environment are obtained and, as a result, the robot's pose is indirectly determined. However, dynamic objects in the actual environment will have a great impact on the accuracy of pose estimation. The position of dynamic features in the global coordinate system changes, affecting the robot's relative pose estimation. GPS-IMU combined navigation is another popular positioning method. When the robot locates in the field, tunnel, underground, or other environments, GPS signals are often blocked, resulting in signal loss. However, the positioning of a single LIDAR or vision sensor is often limited by a specific use environment. For example, the camera cannot be used in low-light conditions. Therefore, the multisensor fusion positioning method has a greater application value. This paper proposes a pose estimation algorithm based on deep learning and adaptive fusion of pose for LIDAR and camera pose estimation in a dynamic environment. Methods This article suggests a pose estimation algorithm for LIDAR and stereo camera pose estimation in a dynamic environment that is based on deep learning and adaptive pose fusion. YOLOv4 is used to extract candidate frames of potential moving objects in the image. Then, the optical flow method is used to track the corner points of the front and rear frames and eliminate dynamic features based on the candidate frame. The reprojection error function is developed from triangulated map and feature points. Nonlinear optimization using RANSAC is used to find the best pose. PointRCNN is used in LIDAR pose estimation to extract candidate frames from a point cloud of potential moving objects. Meanwhile, the linear and planar feature points in the point cloud are extracted and screened according to the candidate frame. The point-to-line and point-to-surface distances are used to construct an error function that calculates the poses of the preceding and following frames. Finally, the pose estimation results of the two are dynamically weighted and fused based on the number of feature points of the image and point cloud. Results and Discussions The public KITTI data set and the experimental data collected by the experimental platform we built in dynamic scenarios are compared to validate the effect of dynamic objects on pose estimation and the effectiveness of the fusion pose estimation algorithm proposed in this paper. First, while comparing, it is discovered that after excluding the dynamic features, the errors of the six components of the pose are reduced in most cases. The comprehensive error of the visual pose algorithm in this paper in the two scenes is reduced by 0.0300° and 0.0167 m on average. The displacement error of the LIDAR pose algorithm is reduced by 0.0010 m; however, the angle error is increased by 0.0016°. Simultaneously, the accuracy of visual pose estimation is more obvious than LIDAR pose estimation (Table 1). The fusion result is compared with the average error of BA, LOAM, and ORBSLAM2. The results of the fusion algorithm used in this paper produce fewer errors in the 05 sequence than the BA vision algorithm and LOAM. Compared with BA and LOAM algorithms, our fusion algorithm's displacement error is reduced by 0. 0105 m and 0. 0010 m, respectively. The displacement errors of our algorithm in scenes 05 and 08 are reduced by 0.0081 m and 0.0026 m compared with the results of ORBSLAM2 algorithm (Table 3). Second, this paper constructs an experimental platform comprising two parallel stereo cameras and LIDAR that simulates the indoor dynamic environment. Six pedestrians move within the field of view of the camera and LIDAR. Experimental results show that after removing dynamic features, the vision and LIDAR pose estimation results outperform the same type of algorithms. The average relative error of the angle and displacement of the fusion result is 0. 0944° and 0.0078 m, which is 0.1918° and 0.0045 m greater than the accuracy of the LOAM algorithm. The accuracy of the algorithm is increased by 0.0100° compared to ORBSLAM2 (Table 4). Conclusions This paper presents a robot pose estimation algorithm that is based on the fusion of dynamic feature elimination images and point clouds. The method of deep learning is used to extract the candidate frame of the target object from an image and point cloud, which is then used for data processing and feature optimization. It completely avoids the error function abnormality caused by incorrect matching of dynamic features and eliminates its effect on the pose estimation. Simultaneously, this paper performs a dynamic weighted fusion of the pose based on the number of feature points. Finally, this paper uses the public KITTI data set and the experimental data collected by the experimental platform construct-in dynamic scenarios to compare the pose estimation accuracy of the three mainstream algorithms of BA, LOAM, and ORBSLAM2. Experiments show that removing dynamic features improves the accuracy of pose estimation to varying degrees. The posture result after fusion is more stable. Furthermore, the sequential processing logic ensures that the system is unaffected by the running time in the offline state to correctly process each frame of data.",adaptive fusion | deep learning | image | LIDAR | machine vision | robot positioning,11,0,,,,undefined,

Unfortunately, energy harvesting computing devices are usually only programmable by experts and require significant supporting toolchains and knowledge across multiple engineering and computing disciplines to work effectively. This paper bridges the gap between sustainable computing efforts, the maker movement, and novice-focused programming environments with MakeCode-Iceberg, a set of compiler extensions to Microsoft's open-source MakeCode project. The extensions automatically and invisibly transform user code in any language supported (Blocks, JavaScript, Python)into a version that can safely and correctly execute across intermittent power failures caused by unreliable energy harvesting. Determining where, when, and what to save in a checkpoint on limited energy, time, and hardware budget is challenging. We leverage the unique intermediate representation of the MakeCode source-to-source compiler to design and deploy various checkpointing techniques. Our approach allows us to provide, for the first time, a fully web-based and toolchain-free environment to program intermittent computing devices, making battery-free operation accessible to all. We demonstrate new use cases with multiple energy harvesters, peripherals, and application domains: including a Smart Terrarium, Step Counter, and Combination Lock.

The first hypothesis is that the tool-use ability emerges when the infant develops enough planning capabilities. The second hypothesis is that the ability emerges when the infant's intrinsic motivation system develops and makes playing with a couple of objects interesting enough so that the infant plays with objects similar to the tool at home and thus acquires the actions needed to retrieve the toy in the lab.

It is important to determine an effective reward function and adjust the agent’s next action to ensure exploitation and exploration. We present a new reward function to ensure the environment’s knowledge in advance for a mobile robot. Additionally, novel mathematical modeling is proposed to provide the optimal selection besides ensuring a rapid convergence. Since a mobile robot has difficulty moving through the path with sharp corners, the smooth path is formed after obtaining the optimal skeleton path. Furthermore, a real-world experiment is given based on the multi-objective function. The benchmark of the proposed IEGQL algorithm with the classical EGQL and A-star algorithms is presented.

Studies to address these problems have achieved some success, but many of these problems persist.

Finally, a trained neural network was used to determine a sequence of joint angles according to the identified actions.

Existing works have proposed grading methods that make various assumptions about the design. However, none of these methods have considered using a design language for the program model. A challenge here is to use a language that eases learning and application in program design. In this paper, we propose a novel grading method, named OOPGRADER, which automatically grades OOP assignments constructed based on an essentially detailed program model. This model is defined in an embedded design language, which directly uses the annotation feature of OOP language to express the essential design rules. We explain how programming assignments can be designed with this language and propose a program checker and a grader for both student and teacher to use in working on the assignments and in grading them. We implement these components in a tool and develop an Eclipse plugin for this tool. We evaluate our method using a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques.

Both the structure and parameters of the AKL model can be trained using a novel L2-norm kernel recursive least squares (L2-KRLS) algorithm.

Allowing programs to respond to changes in the physical environment may influence the types of programs students create and their motivation and interest towards learning programming. We explore this idea by integrating real-time sensor data into Scratch. With our platform, students simply connect a sensor to their computer via USB and use custom blocks, alongside conventional Scratch code, to read and react to the sensor data in real-time. We evaluated this approach using a field study involving 25 students with limited prior experience in Scratch. We found students were highly motivated by the sensors and expressed a strong desire to use them in future projects.

However, using such devices with block-based environments often requires significant technical configuration, which can be challenging in the classroom, especially for very young learners. In this paper, we describe our design, development and use of a sensor toolkit and a companion Scratch extension that is very easy for young students to use. The toolkit allows students to focus on constructive exploration while providing teachers with an easy way to incorporate sensor-driven programming lessons in a time-constrained classroom setting. We deployed our toolkit in a primary school classroom with 19 students aged between 7 and 9, and two teachers who were introducing sensor-driven programming for the first time.

Because they cannot obtain environmental information in time, it is often difficult to make path planning. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a path planning method for mobile robots based on improved reinforcement learning. This method establishes a grid environment model, defines the return value through the number of steps of the robot, and then proposes a changing action selection strategy for the balance between the robot's exploration and utilization of the environment in reinforcement learning, so that the exploration factor dynamically change with the increase of the robot's exploration degree of the environment, thus speeding up the convergence speed of the learning algorithm.

In particular, at each time step, we construct a chance-constrained buffered uncertainty-aware Voronoi cell (B-UAVC) for each robot given a specified collision probability threshold. Probabilistic collision avoidance is achieved by constraining the motion of each robot to be within its corresponding B-UAVC, i.e. the collision probability between the robots and obstacles remains below the specified threshold. The proposed approach is decentralized, communication-free, scalable with the number of robots and robust to robots’ localization and sensing uncertainties.

Under this revolution, known as Industry 4.0 (I40), a robot is no longer static equipment but an active workforce to the factory production alongside human operators. Safety becomes crucial for humans and robots to ensure a smooth production run in such environments. The loss of operating moving robots in plant evacuation can be avoided with the adequate safety induction for them. Operators are subject to frequent safety inductions to react in emergencies, but very little is done for robots. Our research proposes an experimental safety response mechanism for a small manufacturing plant, through which an autonomous robot learns the obstacle-free trajectory to the closest safety exit in emergencies. We implement a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, Q-learning, to enable the path learning abilities of the robot. After obtaining the robot optimal path selection options with Q-learning, we code the outcome as a rule-based system for the safety response. We also program a speech recognition system for operators to react timeously, with a voice command, to an emergency that requires stopping all plant activities even when they are far away from the emergency stops (ESTOPs) button. An ESTOP or a voice command sent directly to the factory central controller can give the factory an emergency signal. We tested this functionality on real hardware from an S7-1200 Siemens programmable logic controller (PLC). We simulate a simple and small manufacturing environment overview to test our safety procedure. Our results show that the safety response mechanism successfully generates paths without obstacles to the closest safety exits from all the factory locations. Our research benefits any manufacturing SME intending to implement the initial and primary use of autonomous moving robots (AMR) in their factories.

This greatly limits the application of binocular vision for robotic arm guidance. Traditional stereo matching algorithms suffer from disparity loss, dilation and other problems, and deep learning algorithms have weakly generalization ability, making high-accuracy results impossible with non-training images. We propose an algorithm that uses segments and edges as matching units. We find the mapping relationship between two-dimensional images and three-dimensional scenes using segments. The algorithm obtains highly accurate results in industrial robotic applications with mainly planar facets. We combine it with a deep learning algorithm to obtain very good high-accuracy results in both general scenes and applications of industrial robots. The algorithm effectively improves the non-linear optimization ability of traditional algorithms and generalization ability of deep learning, and provides an effective method for the binocular vision guidance of industrial robotic scenes. We used the algorithm to guide the robot arm for threading with a success rate of 70%.",binocular vision | industrial robot | stereo matching,2,0,,,NSFC,2017YFC1703303,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Multirobot operations can benefit from this flexibility by actively managing system redundancies depending on current tasks and having more options to respond to failure events. To support this active exploitation of redundancies in robotic systems, this article details an organization model as basis for planning with reconfigurable multirobot systems. The model allows us to exploit redundancies when optimizing a multirobot system's probability of survival with respect to a desired mission. The resulting planning approach trades safety against efficiency in robotic operations and thereby offers a new perspective and tool to design and improve multirobot missions. We use a simulated multirobot planetary exploration mission to evaluate this approach and highlight an exemplary performance landscape.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning method for real-time near-optimal trajectory planning of intelligent vehicles in the presence of moving obstacles. To achieve real-time trajectory planning, a dual heuristic programming (DHP) algorithm is adopted. Furthermore, for achieving active obstacle avoidance in dynamic scenarios, the potential field function is incorporated into the designed actor-critic network.

The lightweight easy deployment of containers made them popular at many data centers. It has captured the market of virtual machines and emerged as lightweight technology that offers better microservices support. Many organizations are widely deploying container technology for handling their diverse and unexpected workload derived from modern applications such as Edge/ Fog computing, Big Data, and IoT in either proprietary clusters or public, private cloud data centers. In the cloud computing environment, scheduling plays a pivotal role. In the same way in container technology, scheduling also plays a critical role in achieving the optimum utilization of available resources. Designing an efficient scheduler is itself a challenging task. The challenges arise from various aspects like the diversity of computing resources and maintaining fairness among numerous tenants, sharing resources with each other as per their requirements, unexpected variation in resource demands and heterogeneity of jobs, etc. This survey provides a multi-perspective overview of container scheduling. Here, we have organized the container scheduling problem into four categories based on the type of optimization algorithm applied to get the linear programming Modeling, heuristic, meta-heuristic, machine learning, and artificial intelligence-based mathematical model. In the previous research work has been done on either Virtual machine placements to Physical Machines or Container instances to Physical machines. This leads to either underutilized PMs or over-utilized PMs. But in this paper, we try to combine both virtualization technology Containers as well as VMs. The primary aim is to optimize resource utilization in terms of CPU time. in this paper, we proposed a meta-heuristics algorithm named Sorted Task-based allocation.

However, as technology integrates itself, the risk of security vulnerabilities and their impact also grows. Different languages have different susceptibilities to cyberattacks. Programs based on C and C++ are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks through buffer overflow errors due to their lack of memory management. While security vulnerabilities are well-studied areas, with the increasing popularity of deep learning applications, the attack scenarios have become more sophis-Ticated, and traditional techniques may no longer be enough to detect attacks or potential vulnerabilities. Therefore, the application of using deep learning to detect such vulnerabilities has become a trend. The appeal of using deep learning in software security is usually based on graphical models and data, which encourages researchers to use graphical-based deep learning methods like Graph Neural Networks (GNN). In this study, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect security vulnerabilities due to its scalability and lower computation need. This paper proposes scanning vulnerable C/C++ functions for vulnerabilities using deep learning-based image classification. Our experiments are performed on the NIST SARD dataset. Inspired by existing high-level language vulnerability detection, we propose converting the function into an image through three steps: sentence embedding, a statically created program dependency graph, and social network analysis.We employ sentence embedding to convert each line of code into an equally sized representative vector. Following this, we produce a program dependency graph (PDG) for each function. Each line of code is then analyzed using three metrics: Katz, closeness, and destructibility. We compute the destructibility metric by employing forward-slicing on the PDG to determine the reachability of each line. The combination of the equally sized vectors and the analysis metrics are used to create a representative image of the source code. Finally, the image is classified through a Convolutional Neural Network.",convolutional neural network | deep learning | security | vulnerability detection,0,0,,,,undefined,

A low-effort modality for task specification is critical for engagement of non-expert end-users and ultimate adoption of personalized robot agents. A widely studied approach to task specification is through goals, using either compact state vectors or goal images from the same robot scene. The former is hard to interpret for non-experts and necessitates detailed state estimation and scene understanding. The latter requires the generation of desired goal image, which often requires a human to complete the task, defeating the purpose of having autonomous robots. In this work, we explore alternate and more general forms of goal specification that are expected to be easier for humans to specify and use such as images obtained from the internet, hand sketches that provide a visual description of the desired task, or simple language descriptions. As a preliminary step towards this, we investigate the capabilities of large scale pre-trained models (foundation models) for zero-shot goal specification, and find promising results in a collection of simulated robot manipulation tasks and real-world datasets.

This book examines different aspects of learning artefacts, pedagogies, content knowledge and assessment methods of AI literacy education, from theoretical discussions to practical recommendations for curriculum and instructional design. An exhaustive summary of current evidence with examples is illustrated in this book, as well as cutting-edge research that serves as an AI literacy model for different countries’ contexts.

These concepts are brought together in Part II, “K-16 AI literacy education” to further summarize the pedagogies, learning content, learning tools and assessment methods to inform K-16 educators how to design their AI instruction at each education level.

It is common to frame imitation learning as a supervised learning problem in which one fits a function approximator to the input-output mapping exhibited by the logged demonstrations (input observations to output actions). While the framing of imitation learning as a supervised input-output learning problem allows for applicability in a wide variety of settings, it is also an overly simplistic view of the problem in situations where the expert demonstrations provide much richer insight into expert behavior. For example, applications such as path navigation, robot manipulation, and strategy games acquire expert demonstrations via planning, search, or some other multi-step algorithm, revealing not just the output action to be imitated but also the procedure for how to determine this action. While these intermediate computations may use tools not available to the agent during inference (e.g., environment simulators), they are nevertheless informative as a way to explain an expert's mapping of state to actions. To properly leverage expert procedure information without relying on the privileged tools the expert may have used to perform the procedure, we propose procedure cloning, which applies supervised sequence prediction to imitate the series of expert computations. This way, procedure cloning learns not only what to do (i.e., the output action), but how and why to do it (i.e., the procedure). Through empirical analysis on navigation, simulated robotic manipulation, and game-playing environments, we show that imitating the intermediate computations of an expert's behavior enables procedure cloning to learn policies exhibiting significant generalization to unseen environment configurations, including those configurations for which running the expert's procedure directly is infeasible.",,1,0,,,,undefined,Antares Pharma

In addition, curriculum learning is embedded in this approach to facilitate learning by reducing the complexity of the environment. Conducted experiments demonstrate how the reinforcement learning-based approach can be applied to three different industrial manipulators in simulation with minimal configuration changes.

Reinforcement learning, as an artificial intelligence algorithm with excellent performance in the field of path planning, has also gradually become the object of research on path planning. In order to find a fast path from the starting point to the end point of a mobile robot in a complex environment, reinforcement learning is used to find a valid path by sensing the environment and continuously receiving rewarding feedback through a method of trial and error learning like humans. Therefore, this paper selects two algorithms to verify their effectiveness on the basis of building a two-dimensional grid map.

In the experiment, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated by the number of entering the pedestrian person space, the time cost and the trajectory length.

While recent works have shown promising results by using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to learn socially-aware navigation policies, most approaches are limited to local, short-term navigation. For more complex settings, DRL approaches rely on subgoals often computed using traditional path planners. However, these planners are not necessarily suitable for social navigation since they rarely consider the pedestrians in the scene and often disregard the long term cost of a path or the pedestrian dynamics. In this paper, we present an alternative global planner that uses a learnt local cost predictor to generate subgoal guidance to help a DRL robot to make progress towards its goal while also taking into account the pedestrians in the environment. We evaluate the proposed approach in simulation. We consider several environments of varying complexity as well as different pedestrian behaviours. Our results show that a DRL robot using the proposed planner is less likely to collide with pedestrians and exhibits improved social awareness when compared to a baseline approach using traditional path planner methods.",Deep reinforcement learning | Motion and path planning | Social robot navigation,0,0,,,,undefined,

These reactive behaviors, however, are often incapable of reasoning and predicting the effects of their actions in the next future. Therefore, they must be accompanied by forms of deliberative semantic/causal reasoning. The combination of the reactive and deliberative forms of reasoning, which resembles the dual process theory, raises the problem of entrusting tasks to the corresponding modules. Just as happens in biological systems, the tendency to assign activities, as much as possible, towards the lower abstraction layers, equips the systems with more responsive capabilities at the cost of making the reactive layers more difficult to implement. In this document, we will introduce an architecture that, inspired by the classic three-tier architecture, combines slow and fast forms of reasoning, allowing social robots to achieve complex and dynamic behaviors. Since entrusting tasks to the more reactive components complicates their implementation (e.g., it requires the definition of formal rules which may not adequately generalize to unforeseen scenarios), we aim to reduce the technicalities and, consequently, to facilitate to the developers the implementation of the reactive behaviors. By relying on recent achievements in natural language translation, we will describe our recent efforts to adopt Transformer-based architectures, allowing the replacement of formal rules with easier to write “stories”, defined through sequences of perceived events and actions, entrusting the system with the task of learning behaviors by generalizing from them.",Adaptive human-robot interaction | Automated planning and execution | Dynamic adaptation,0,0,,,,undefined,

The robotic arm, which is widely used in industrial production, comes with high energy usage. In order to reduce energy usage, we propose an energy-efficient motion planning and control method based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to reduce energy consumption during operation. The motion planning and control policy is learned in a model-free manner using RL, making it effective even in complex industrial environments. The main goal can be divided into three parts: moving to the target location, obstacle avoidance, and energy saving. From this, a comprehensive and effective reward function is designed using a distance reward, a velocity reward, an obstacle avoidance reward, and an energy-saving reward. Using this reward function, a control policy is trained which balances the aforementioned goals. Finally, the algorithm is verified by using the trained policy to avoid obstacles in a simulation environment. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the algorithm proposed, and show that the learned control policy can make the robot move with less energy whilst avoiding obstacles.",Energy Efficient | Motion Planning | Reinforcement Learning,0,0,,,NKRDPC,2018YFB1701202,National Key Research and Development Program of China

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), an efficient decision-making method, has been widely used to solve path-planning problems. Nonetheless, as the map size increases, the existing DRL algorithms are prone to the problem of sparse rewards. The above drawback makes the mobile robot converge slowly on the map. Even in extreme cases such as trap maps, the robot obtains the optimal convergent solution differently. For this purpose, this paper encodes the various node information in the map separately as a state description of the environment. To efficiently perform path-planning tasks for mobile robots in various complex scenarios, a time-sensitive reward function based on DRL is presented. The simulation experiments on a variety of complex environmental maps are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, applying RL algorithms on safety-critical systems still needs to be well justified due to the exploration nature of many RL algorithms, especially when the model of the robot and the environment are unknown. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven safety layer that acts as a filter for unsafe actions. The safety layer uses a data-driven predictive controller to enforce safety guarantees for RL policies during training and after deployment. The RL agent proposes an action that is verified by computing the data-driven reachability analysis. If there is an intersection between the reachable set of the robot using the proposed action, we call the data-driven predictive controller to find the closest safe action to the proposed unsafe action. The safety layer penalizes the RL agent if the proposed action is unsafe and replaces it with the closest safe one. In the simulation, we show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art safe RL methods on the robotics navigation problem for a Turtlebot 3 in Gazebo and a quadrotor in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4).",Reinforcement learning | robot safety | task and motion planning,0,0,repositoryam,Green,H2020,830927,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

Nowadays, following the advances in technology and industry 4.0, these objectives have changed to more demanding ones. These require flexible and autonomous intelligent solutions, i.e. systems capable of performing a variety of tasks with the minimum programming or system specifications. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence, novel algorithms have been developed, and let improve robotics systems capabilities by becoming more intelligent and autonomous. The aim of this work is the development of an adaptative intelligent robotic system for physical interaction tasks.

However, the need to manually design the symbols restrict their applicability, especially for robots that are expected to act in open-ended environments. Therefore symbol formation and rule extraction should be considered part of robot learning, which, when done properly, will offer scalability, flexibility, and robustness. Towards this goal, we propose a novel general method that finds action-grounded, discrete object and effect categories and builds probabilistic rules over them for non-trivial action planning. Our robot interacts with objects using an initial action repertoire that is assumed to be acquired earlier and observes the effects it can create in the environment. To form action-grounded object, effect, and relational categories, we employ a binary bottleneck layer in a predictive, deep encoder-decoder network that takes the image of the scene and the action applied as input, and generates the resulting effects in the scene in pixel coordinates. After learning, the binary latent vector represents action-driven object categories based on the interaction experience of the robot. To distill the knowledge represented by the neural network into rules useful for symbolic reasoning, a decision tree is trained to reproduce its decoder function. Probabilistic rules are extracted from the decision paths of the tree and are represented in the Probabilistic Planning Domain Definition Language (PPDDL), allowing off-the-shelf planners to operate on the knowledge extracted from the sensorimotor experience of the robot. The deployment of the proposed approach for a simulated robotic manipulator enabled the discovery of discrete representations of object properties such as 'rollable' and 'insertable'. In turn, the use of these representations as symbols allowed the generation of effective plans for achieving goals, such as building towers of the desired height, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach for multi-step object manipulation. Finally, we demonstrate that the system is not only restricted to the robotics domain by assessing its applicability to the MNIST 8-puzzle domain in which learned symbols allow for the generation of plans that move the empty tile into any given position.",,2,1,repositoryam,Green,KAKEN,22H03670,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science

This can help to balance key performance indicators (KPIs) such as safety and task performance since they can often affect each other.

Another relevant aspect in robotic kits is the possibility for children to follow the code execution at runtime.

However, the performance of the reinforcement learning-based motion planning algorithm for manipulators is closely related to the quality of the reward function, which is typically designed manually. In this paper, inspired by heuristic functions, a new learning-based reward function design framework is proposed. By relaxing the constraint of the original motion planning problem, a simple task is established. The cost of a solution to the simple task is taken as a heuristic for the original problem, and the heuristic is then incorporated into the reward function. We tested the performance of heuristic-guided reward functions based on the soft-actor-critic algorithm in various difficult scenarios. The experimental results showed that our reward function design method improves the convergence speed of the reinforcement learning training process and the planning success rate of the policy obtained after the training. In addition, the trained motion planning policy could be directly transferred to a real manipulator for online execution without modification, thus verifying the flexibility of the strategy between simulated and real environments.",heuristic function | manipulator | motion planning | reinforcement learning | reward function,0,0,,,,undefined,

The cooperative behavior of these robots enables them to perform the task assigned to the other robot while the other robot is facing a malfunction or failure. The path planning process is realized using reinforcement learning for namely the Temporal Difference (TD) algorithm. The work also emphasizes on catering the existing TD algorithm to work for multi robotic system thereby increasing the efficiency of the system. The simulation of multi robotic system is carried out with the helpof Python 3.8.5 and SpyderIDE.",Multi-robot | Path Planning | Python | Reinforcement Learning | Static environment | Temporal Difference,0,0,,,,undefined,

The STEM education provides courses to educate students in four disciplines, i.e. science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. In addition, transforming current industry to a modern industry needs the support from a group of professional people who are familiar with the core technologies of ID 4.0, such as virtual and real Integration systems, cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence(AI). Programming is the key to make the above industrial revolution success. Thus, our previous project developed a low cost humanoid robot as a learning tool applied in STEM programs. With the assistance of the humanoid robot, young students can learn programming courses easily and efficiently. Currently, STEM education is often applied in elementary, junior-high and senior-high schools. It really improves students' learning circumstance in STEM fields. This paper introduced the STEAM education model to create a good learning circumstance for art students. Digital teaching aids, such as humanoid robot, and quadruped mechanical animal, support students to learn STEM programs more intuitively. Those aids can help students to learn mechanical mechanisms, electronic motors, digital control and programming and so on. These teaching aids are all open source, and they can be printed by 3D printers. Students can learn mechanics, electronics, and programming via the course. In order to enable students to use the humanoid robot digital teaching aids more effectively and completely, a humanoid robot motion editor is developed. This editor was developed by python and VTK, and it also has a friendly window-based interface. Its main task is to provide students to edit the motion of the robots quickly and easily.

In this paper, we propose the enhancement of these skills for passivity-based skill motion learning in stiffness-adaptive unified force-impedance control. To achieve the increased level of adaptability, we represent all tactile skills by three basic primitives: contact initiation, manipulation, and contact termination. To ensure passivity and stability, we develop an energy-based approach for unified force-impedance control that allows humans to teach the robot motion through physical interaction during the execution of a tactile task. We incorporate our proposed framework into a tactile robot to experimentally validate the motion adaptation by interaction performance and stability of the control. While the polishing task is presented as our use case through the paper, the experiments can also be carried out with various tactile skills.

It may contain information about the risk, energy, or time consumption needed to traverse the terrain. To avoid hand-crafted traversability cost functions we propose to collect traversability information about the robot and locomotion policy by simulating the traversal over randomly generated terrains using a physics simulator. Thousand of robots are simulated in parallel controlled by the same locomotion policy used in reality to acquire 57 years of real-world locomotion experience equivalent. For deployment on the real robot, a sparse convolutional network is trained to predict the simulated traversability cost, which is tailored to the deployed locomotion policy, from an entirely geometric representation of the envi-ronment in the form of a 3D voxel-occupancy map.

When using only monocular image sensor data as input, classical two-dimensional planning approaches cannot be used. While images present a significant challenge when it comes to perception and planning, they also allow capturing potentially important details, such as complex geometry, body movement, and other visual cues. In order to successfully solve the navigation task from only images, algorithms must be able to model the scene and its dynamics using only this channel of information. We investigate whether the world model concept, which has shown state-of-the-art results for modeling and learning policies in Atari games as well as promising results in 2D LiDAR-based crowd navigation, can also be applied to the camera-based navigation problem. To this end, we create simulated environments where a robot must navigate past static and moving humans without colliding in order to reach its goal. We find that state-of-the-art methods are able to achieve success in solving the navigation problem, and can generate dream-like predictions of future image-sequences which show consistent geometry and moving persons.

However, by breaking down the navigation problem into these sub-tasks, we limit the robot's capabilities since the individual tasks do not consider the full solution space. In this work, we propose to solve the complete problem by training an end-to-end policy with deep reinforcement learning. Instead of continuously tracking a precomputed path, the robot needs to reach a target position within a provided time. The task's success is only evaluated at the end of an episode, meaning that the policy does not need to reach the target as fast as possible. It is free to select its path and the locomotion gait. Training a policy in this way opens up a larger set of possible solutions, which allows the robot to learn more complex behaviors. We compare our approach to velocity tracking and additionally show that the time dependence of the task reward is critical to successfully learn these new behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate the successful deployment of policies on a real quadrupedal robot. The robot is able to cross challenging terrains, which were not possible previously, while using a more energy-efficient gait and achieving a higher success rate.

To solve this electricity consumption issue, the problem of efficient path planning for cleaning robot has become important and many studies have been conducted. However, most of them are about moving along a simple path segment, not about the whole path to clean all places. As the emerging deep learning technique, reinforcement learning (RL) has been adopted for cleaning robot. However, the models for RL operate only in a specific cleaning environment, not the various cleaning environment. The problem is that the models have to retrain whenever the cleaning environment changes. To solve this problem, the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is combined with an efficient path planning that operates in various cleaning environments, using transfer learning (TL), detection nearest cleaned tile, reward shaping, and making elite set methods. The proposed method is validated with an ablation study and comparison with conventional methods such as random and zigzag. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improved training performance and increased convergence speed over the original PPO.

Despite the current development in this direction, the efficient capture and processing of important sequential and spatial information, in a direct and simultaneous way, is still relatively under-explored. To overcome the challenge and unlock the potentials of neural networks for motion planning tasks, in this paper, we propose STP-Net, an end-to-end learning framework that can fully extract and leverage important spatio-temporal information to form an efficient neural motion planner. By interpreting the movement of the robot as a video clip, robot motion planning is transformed to a video prediction task that can be performed by STP-Net in both spatially and temporally efficient ways. Empirical evaluations across different seen and unseen environments show that, with nearly 100% accuracy (aka, success rate), STP-Net demonstrates very promising performance with respect to both planning speed and path cost. Compared with existing NN-based motion planners, STP-Net achieves at least 5×, 2.6× and 1.8× faster speed with lower path cost on 2D Random Forest, 2D Maze and 3D Random Forest environments, respectively.

During the sampling process, random sampling nodes are performed with a probability of ϵ, or those nodes with the highest pheromone content in the current sampling tree are selected with a probability of 1-ϵ and sampled in their neighborhood. To avoid the local minimum problem, the concept of pheromone volatile factor (PVF) is proposed, while in the expansion, double trees are also generated by PRRT in both cartesian and configuration spaces to improve the speed of the algorithm.

However, several problems remain related to their practical use, such as the need for expensive hardware and high power consumption levels. In this study, we build a low-cost indoor mobile robot platform that does not include a LiDAR or a GPU. Then, we design an autonomous navigation architecture that guarantees real-time performance on our platform with an RGB-D camera and a low-end off-the-shelf single board computer. The overall system includes SLAM, global path planning, ground segmentation, and motion planning. The proposed ground segmentation approach extracts a traversability map from raw depth images for the safe driving of low-body mobile robots. We apply both rule-based and learning-based navigation policies using the traversability map. Running sensor data processing and other autonomous driving components simultaneously, our navigation policies perform rapidly at a refresh rate of 18 Hz for control command, whereas other systems have slower refresh rates. Our methods show better performances than current state-of-the-art navigation approaches within limited computation resources as shown in 3D simulation tests.

A functional unit is generated based on the linguistic instructions in the recipe. Since most recipes lack the necessary information for executing the motion, we first consider extracting the information about the cooking motion like cutting from the food images of the recipe and supplementing it. In addition, to supplement the actions that humans perform unconsciously, we generate functional units for actions not explicitly mentioned in the recipe based on the current situation of the cooking process, and then connect them to the functional units generated from the recipe. Moreover, during the connection we consider the motion of the robot's arms in parallel for an efficient execution of the recipe, similar to those of a human. Through experiments, we demonstrate that for a given recipe, the proposed method can be used to generate a cooking sequence with the supplementary information needed, and executed by a dual-arm robot.

The proposed algorithm is capable of undertaking local path planning for mobile robots in unknown dynamic environments with a moving goal. The inability to track and reach a moving goal is one of the common weaknesses of most existing navigation algorithms operating in dynamic environments. High uncertainty involved in dynamic environments is also another major challenge. The novel machine learning-based approach helps the proposed algorithm to successfully overcome these challenges. This paper also introduces the integrated modular-based architecture for free-space attraction-based algorithms. This allows the algorithm to incorporate ten different modules with miscellaneous algorithms to perform sub-tasks such as tracking, prediction, map generation, machine learning-based free space attraction force generation and robot motion command generation. The new modular-based architecture integrates those sub-modules to create the robot's driving force. This driving force is the single attractive force to pull the robot towards the moving goal via current free space leading to future free space passages. The proposed algorithm was experimentally tested under a dynamic environment. The experiment was focused on testing the behaviour of the algorithm under the challenge of reaching a moving goal.

We designed a network that accepts the cropped Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) representation of the scene about a point and its corresponding normal, and for that point, it predicts the yaw angle of a grasp configuration, its probability of success, and the offset of grasp along the normal. Here, we convert the 6-DOF grasp detection problem into a 2-DOF grasp representation problem, thereby reducing the dimensionality of our grasp representation, which enhances the learning process. Our approach can detect grasps at a point in only 60 milliseconds.

Students struggle to learn embedded systems, connect embedded topics between courses, and apply those topics to real-world applications, thus facilitating a need for Modular Embedded Tools (METs) integrated within an electrical and computer engineering curriculum. Current projects within the curriculum do not sufficiently engage students, educate on embedded topics, nor inspire curiosity for independent learning. Courses covering embedded systems, including Introduction to Engineering, Digital Systems: Logic Design, Fundamentals of Analog Circuits, Digital Systems: Hardware Programming, Embedded Systems: Microcontrollers, Embedded Systems: System On A Chip, Junior Design, and Senior Design have been targeted for study. An understanding of the current level of student engagement with present-day curriculum projects must be established to aid in the development of the METs system.

The computing landscape is in the midst of significant changes. Hardware and software systems are becoming highly data intensive, specialized, parallel, and heterogeneous. With these developments, new applications across a wide range of disciplines are being enabled, from agriculture, mechanical and control systems, and many other physical sciences. For this reason, new approaches for teaching, via hands-on experiences, with these systems is needed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that can be used to support learning objectives for these systems, at the intersection of multiple disciplines (e.g. computer science, data science, mechanical/aerospace/industrial/computer engineering). Specifically, we describe a flexible computing platform, that supports the exploration of custom hardware and software, interfaces, communications, and integrated system design. The RISC-V based system-on-chip architecture and supporting software and programming tools provide a unique opportunity for students to quickly learn advanced computing concepts critical to future computing systems. An implementation of the framework is described in the context of an important class of control applications, system identification and motion control. As these systems scale, analyzing non-linear system dynamics requires non-traditional approaches, e.g. using modern learning-based models and tools. The proposed approach allows for students to explore the impact of computing abstractions, data-intensive system design, and the potential for cross layer optimizations, while also learning key concepts related to parallel programming models and architectures. Based on this case study, we also provide an analysis and discussion of potential curricular activities that could leverage the framework. A key obstacle for such engineering education research, is the lack of familiarity that students in different disciplines have for the other fields of study, making a complete understanding of overall system design principles difficult. This paper presents a framework for multidisciplinary synergy that alleviates this problem and elevates computing systems to a potentially critical position in engineering education.",computing education | cross-layer design | multidisciplinary engineering,0,0,,,,undefined,

Yet, learning new technologies and developing pedagogical activities that incorporate such tools could be a challenge for teachers. Because of the different background knowledge of the participants in this study and also their students, the traditional ex-cathedra approach might not be suitable to promote quality progression, facilitate experimentation and interestingness with the platform, and maintain interestObjective: This innovative practice full paper presents a user experience and usability study targeting teachers. The first aim of the study was to investigate the personal experience of teachers and reveal issues associated with the utilization of the platform and materials. On the other hand, the second objective was related to the practical applicability of such in their everyday teaching. Teachers' feedback and recommendations are important for the improvement of the materials to fit the needs of the classroom and to make use of the full potential a platform offers.Methods: Data collection was conducted during the workshop utilizing an emerging developing microcontroller, VIDI X. VIDI X is a new educational tool that can have ample uses in technology education as a multifunctional microcontroller, a developing board, or as a cluster hub with multiple sensors. The workshop aimed to familiarize teachers with the new learning tool and propose content and pedagogy that could be adapted to the classroom environment. They constituted a basic introduction to electronic components and programming in Arduino IDE. The instructional methodology for the workshop was based on instructional scaffolding. The workbook was organized into lessons with gradually increasing task difficulty. The educators provided instructions when needed to each participant individually. To evaluate the content of the workshop and the microcontroller, a questionnaire was administered immediately after the workshop. The questionnaire comprised: 1) participants' background information, 2) content of the workshop, and 3) VIDI X. User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) that covers attractiveness, pragmatic, and hedonic quality was utilized to appraise VIDI X.Results: The analysis of the workshop questionnaire showed that the teachers' liked the workshop and the workbook. Furthermore, the microcontroller and the workbook are suitable for high school students. The analysis of the UEQ showed that the VIDI X was perceived positively on all items, and scales compared to the UEQ benchmark.Conclusion: As today's students have different prior knowledge in the field of programming, electronics and robotics, the proposed workshop where everyone is progressing at their own pace accompanied with the support of educators, seems to be a good approach to educating in the future.",Computer science education | educational innovation | educational technology | human-computer interaction (HCI) | ICT platform | microcontroller | STEM | teacher training | technology-assisted learning | user experience | VIDI X,0,0,,,HRZZ,ESF-DOK-2018-01,Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost

Since navigation is a multi-objective optimization problem, a novel reward function considering different contradicted criteria including reaching the target and avoiding the obstacles is proposed in this paper.

Even though Python is now the most used language for introductory courses, many advanced CS courses, such as Operating Systems and Em-bedded Computing, still benefit from using the C language. Thus, instructors now face a new challenge: teaching C to students who are already proficient in a higher-level language. Since this must be done in addition to their existing course, it is necessary to (i) be fast; and (ii) assure that students learned enough to be successful in the courses. An approach described in previous work was to concentrate all courses that benefit from using C (Computer Systems, Embedded Computing and Programming Challenges) in a single semester and joining their classes for the first week of the semester. This resulted in promising preliminary results, but lacked a more rigorous assessment in order to draw more meaningful conclusions. Concept Inventories (CI) can be used to both assess how many students have accurate knowledge of the subject but also to identify common pitfalls and misconceptions. In this work we combine three years of experiences in teaching C in advanced CS courses with data from the application of an Introductory C programming CI. We have received 109 responses from three consecutive offerings, detailing student performance in seven key areas. Satisfactory performance was obtained in Parameter use and scope, Iteration, Recursion, Structures and Pointers. Variable Scope and Boolean Expressions were the most challenging areas. We analyze the most common misconceptions and relate them to the material and students' previous experiences. A questionnaire answered by students (N=56) at the end of the activity is analyzed in order to understand the level of affinity of students with the C language before the course and their perceptions about it, we noticed that most students have not had contact with the language before and feel motivated to learn C. To verify the knowledge in the language on a practical project, we analyzed the first big delivery of code that they have to do after two weeks the end of the course , through the analysis of the students codes (N=58) we can measure that many students use more advanced resources of the language that were not seen in the course or taught officially by other courses, indicating that they were able to learn enough of the language to go it alone in more complex matters.",Concept Inventory | Misconceptions,0,0,,,,undefined,

Traditional motion planning methods usually transform the problem into finding the optimal solution of objective function under constraint conditions or some sampling-based method, but these methods can't cope well with the unstructured and incomplete observation environment. In recent years, reinforcement learning has proved to be a promising direction to solve this problem, but sports planning based on reinforcement learning also faces many problems, such as low efficiency of data utilization, dimension disaster, and insufficient robustness. We try to compress the dimensions of the motion space. Instead of using the manipulator directly as the object of the motion planning policy output action, consider the action output of each joint motor locally. We propose an approach in which each joint of the manipulator is modeled as an agent, and use multiagent centralized training and decentralized execution multiagent reinforcement learning method to plan the motion of the manipulator. The experiment shows that we can greatly shorten the training time of the motion planning task and obtain better positioning accuracy and environmental robustness.",,0,0,,,,undefined,

Therefore, in this paper, an RL algorithm called Q-learning is used to get the safe and shortest path from a start point (SP) to a goal point (GP) in a home environment. The path trajectories are obtained by using polynomial curve fitting. The closed-loop inverse kinematics (CLIK) algorithm is used to control a three-wheeled omni-directional mobile robot to follow the desired path. The simulation and plotting are done using MATLAB.

Role-based characteristics of E-CARGO will facilitate cooperative decision-making and simplify handling failure. This paper develops an extended E-CARGO model for a fault resilience role engine. Agents use factor graphs to update the process role and manage the potential failure in each time step. We apply hybrid control in this paper. By 'hybrid' we mean that evaluating and assigning initial roles are centralized, and role-playing is decentralized based on the local observations. The RBC life cycle and a Bayesian consensus will maintain fault resilience behaviors. Potential failure can be identified in a Bayesian way by updating agents' reliability and calling the central unit to assign new process roles to guarantee robustness.

Traditionally, in the AI community, heuristic search methods (e.g., based on Dijkstra, text{A}, or random trees) are used to solve this problem. This search, however, incurs a high computational cost that grows with the size and resolution of the obstacle grid and has to be mitigated with effective heuristics to allow path planning in real-time. This work introduces a learning framework using a deep neural network with a stackable convolution kernel to establish a hierarchy of directional traversability representations with decreasing resolution that can serve as an efficient heuristic to guide a multi-resolution path planner. This path planner finds paths efficiently, starting on the lowest resolution traversability representation and then refining the path incrementally through the hierarchy until it addresses the original obstacle constraints. We demonstrate the benefits and applicability of this approach on datasets of maps created to represent both indoor and outdoor environments to represent different real-world applications. The conducted experiments show that our method can accelerate path planning by 40% in indoor environments and 65% in outdoor environments compared to the same heuristic search method applied to the original obstacle map, which demonstrates the effectiveness of this method.",,0,0,,,NSF,76019-0015,National Science Foundation

Our system contains both global and local path planners, allowing robot to generate path through iterations of learning. The VR interface allows user to interact with environment and to assist quadruped robot in challenging scenarios. The results of comparison experiments show that cooperation between human and path planning algorithms can increase the computational speed of the algorithm by 35.58% in average, and non-critically increasing of the path length (average of 6.66%) in test scenario. Additionally, users described VR interface as not requiring physical demand (2.3 out of 10) and highly evaluated their performance (7.1 out of 10).

As many situations that CPS encounter at runtime are not foreseeable at design time, (online) learning approaches are attractive for such systems. Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a promising learning approach for CPS thanks to their rather low computational complexity. They operate on a set of rules that describe potential adaptation behavior. So far, specifying rules for a learning classifier system is a tedious task that requires expert knowledge. In this paper, we present Rango - an intuitive rule language for learning classifier systems - to overcome this challenge. Compared to existing approaches, Rango has a strong focus on CPS and provides a large variety of corresponding keywords. In addition, Rango rules are automatically transferred into a representation that is usable in a learning classifier system without any modifications. Rango therefore empowers system administrators to formulate rules and, hence, leverage an online learning approach for their use case without having prior experience with learning classifier systems. We evaluate Rango extensively with (i) a complexity analysis of parsing and rule evaluation, (ii) a usefulness study which shows that Rango facilitates both the writing of rules and the understanding of LCS output and (iii) a usability study, which proves that basic programming knowledge is sufficient to understand and formulate Rango rules.",adaptation | context-free grammar | cyberphysical systems | learning classifier systems | rule language,0,0,,,,undefined,

Instead, fog computing has been proposed by researchers from industry and academia to extend the capability of the cloud right to the point where the data is collected at the sensing layer.

However, the effectiveness of these applications in the learning environments is contingent upon factors including but not limited to applications' ease of use, relevance to courses, students' engagement with the application, and perceived value of the application in the context of students' learning. This work-in-progress paper uses two aspects of engagement in a mobile technology-mediated learning environment and explores their relationship with students' academic performances. The two perspectives of engagement include 1) students' engagement with the course - Academic Engagement and 2) students' engagement with the application used in the course - Application Engagement. We collected the data from 110 first-year engineering students enrolled in a required engineering class programming in MATLAB. Students self-reported their academic engagement on four dimensions: behavioral, emotional, social, and cognitive. In addition, students used a mobile application called CourseMIRROR. The application prompted students to write their reflections on each lecture throughout the semester, asking about its interesting or confusing points. The application uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm to create the summaries of these reflections. For application engagement, we used the number of times students viewed the summary through embedded data analytics in the CourseMIRROR application. For students' academic performance, we used the students' total scores in the course. We hypothesize that these two engagement perspectives are related to the students' academic performance. Specifically, the study will be guided by the following research questions: 1) To what degree do students' academic and application engagement relate to their academic performance? And 2) Do students with high engagement (i.e., academic or application) perform better in their exams? We analyzed the data using Pearson product-moment correlation and multiple regression to predict the students' academic performance and its relationship with students' academic engagement and application engagement.

The navigation system uses onboard cameras to generate an occupancy map and a corresponding cost map to reach the goal. A fast marching planner then generates a target path. A velocity command generator takes this as input to generate the desired velocity for the walking policy. A safety advisor module adds sensed unexpected obstacles to the occupancy map and environment-determined speed limits to the velocity command generator. We show superior performance compared to wheeled robot baselines, and ablation studies which have disjoint high-level planning and low-level control. We also show the real-world deployment of VP-Nav on a quadruped robot with onboard sensors and computation.

However, robot motions are mostly planned and preprogramed with a notable lack of adaptivity to task changes. Even for slightly changed tasks, the whole system must be reprogrammed by robotics experts. Therefore, it is highly desirable to have a flexible motion planning method, with which robots can adapt to certain task changes in unstructured environments, such as production systems or warehouses, with little or no intervention needed from non-expert personnel. In this paper, we propose a user-guided motion planning algorithm in combination with reinforcement learning (RL) method to enable robots to automatically generate their motion plans for new tasks by learning from a few common tasks saved as primitive actions by kinesthetic human demonstrations. Features of these primitive actions are captured through screw transformation of the end-effector during the task. A mapping method is developed to convert features of primitive actions to new task segments and further used to construct the reward function in RL. A Q-learning algorithm is applied to train the motion planning policy, following which an adaptive motion plan for the new task can be generated or a request for additional primitive actions will be returned if current primitive actions are insufficient for satisfying new task constraints. Multiple experiments conducted on common tasks and scenarios demonstrate that the proposed RL-based motion planning method is effective.",,2,0,,,NSF,CMMI1853454,National Science Foundation

Machine learning has been leveraged in recent years to improve the efficiency of path-planning approaches, particularly those based on Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT). The general idea is to train a neural network using an extensive dataset consisting of solutions obtained by RRT for problems generated at random, and then leveraging the trained neural network to improve the sampling and exploration conducted by RRT on new problems.This paper makes the case that the time to generate the datasets can be drastically reduced by using probabilistic roadmaps (PRM) instead of RRT. Roadmaps make it possible to capture the connectivity of the environment and solve multiple path-planning problems efficiently. We use the datasets to train neural networks based on U-NET. The trained networks are then leveraged to guide exploration. Specifically, we develop two path planners, namely Neural-Network-Guided PRM and RRT, denoted as NNG-PRM and NNG-RRT. Experiments are conducted using a series of challenging obstacle-rich environments where the robot has to wiggle its way through numerous narrow passages. The results show that using PRM instead of RRT drastically reduces the time to generate the datasets from hours to minutes.

The irregularity arises from the seemingly random connections of nodes, which makes the DAG structure unsuitable for vectorization on CPU or GPU. Moreover, the nodes usually represent a small number of arithmetic operations that cannot amortize the overhead of launching tasks/kernels for each node, further posing challenges for parallel execution. To enable energy-efficient execution, this work proposes DAG processing unit (DPU) version 2, a specialized processor architecture optimized for irregular DAGs with static connectivity. It consists of a tree-structured datapath for efficient data reuse, a customized banked register file, and interconnects tuned to support irregular register accesses. DPU-v2 is utilized effectively through a targeted compiler that systematically maps operations to the datapath, minimizes register bank conflicts, and avoids pipeline hazards. Finally, a design space exploration identifies the optimal architecture configuration that minimizes the energy-delay product. This hardware-software co-optimization approach results in a speedup of 1.4 ×, 3.5 ×, and 14 × over a state-of-the-art DAG processor ASIP, a CPU, and a GPU, respectively, while also achieving a lower energy-delay product.

In surgical robotics complex robotic structures and actuation mechanisms are generally employed, therefore machine learning techniques can be adopted to build the model of the robot. Probabilistic neural networks are a class of learning approaches that provide information about the uncertainty of the learnt models. In this work we compare two different probabilistic neural networks (Bayesian and Evidential Neural Networks) to model the kinematics of a surgical robotic instrument and propose a control strategy based on Hierarchical Quadratic Programming (HQP) capable of exploiting the model uncertainty to improve the accuracy and safety of the controller. Simulation and real world experiments on different autonomous path tracking tasks show that the model uncertainty highly affects the control performances and prove the effectiveness of the proposed controller in improving task execution. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;The push towards reducing invasiveness and patient&#x2019;s traumas in surgery has lead to the requirement of miniaturized and highly articulated robots. This however comes at the cost of having systems that are hard to model and control, which is one of the major limitations for autonomy in surgical robotics. Machine learning has become very effective in modelling complex systems and probabilistic approaches additionally allow estimating the confidence of the learnt model. In robotics field where high precision is required to perform an autonomous task, like in minimally invasive surgery, the robot model needs to be very accurate and controllers need to guarantee safety in performing the desired task, while satisfying additional motion constraints imposed by the application scenario. This work proposes the use of probabilistic neural networks to model the complexity of a surgical robotic instrument and a control strategy capable of ensuring safety by maximizing model&#x2019;s confidence and guaranteeing satisfaction of imposed motion constraints. In this work a macro-micro manipulator setup is employed, consisting of an articulated surgical robotic instrument connected to a serial-link manipulator. The proposed modelling and control approaches can be used in any other field where controllers need to highly rely on the robot model due to limitations in using external sensors and where leveraging information about model&#x2019;s confidence can be beneficial.

It interfaces with various physics engines to model diverse material types necessary for simulating caregiving scenarios, and provides the capability to plan, control, and learn both human and robot control policies by integrating with state-of-the-art external planning and learning libraries, and VR devices. We propose a set of realistic caregiving tasks in RCareWorld as a benchmark for physical robotic caregiving and provide baseline control policies for them.

Many developed risk-aware path planners explicitly limit the probability of collision to an acceptable bound in uncertain environments. However, convex obstacles or Gaussian uncertainties are usually assumed to make the problem tractable in the existing method. These assumptions limit the generalization and application of path planners in real-world implementations. In this article, we propose to apply deep learning methods to the sampling-based planner, developing a novel risk bounded near-optimal path planning algorithm named neural risk-aware RRT (NR-RRT). Specifically, a deterministic risk contours map is maintained by perceiving the probabilistic nonconvex obstacles, and a neural network sampler is proposed to predict the next most-promising safe state. Furthermore, the recursive divide-and-conquer planning and bidirectional search strategies are used to accelerate the convergence to a near-optimal solution with guaranteed bounded risk. Worst-case theoretical guarantees can also be proven owing to a standby safety guaranteed planner utilizing a uniform sampling distribution. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art for finding risk bounded low-cost paths in uncertain nonconvex environments with seen and unseen scene layouts. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;This article is motivated by developing an efficient risk-aware path planner that can quickly find risk bounded solutions in uncertain nonconvex environments for practical applications, such as autonomous vehicles and search-and-rescue robots. Sampling-based planning approaches such as rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) and its variants are popular for their good performance in exploring the state space. However, it is quite time-consuming to look for risk bounded paths in uncertain environments, especially under nonconvex and non-Gaussian constraints. The initial paths are often of poor quality. Therefore, we propose the NR-RRT algorithm to rapidly find near-optimal solutions with guaranteed bounded risk. It utilizes an informed bidirectional search strategy after having past experiences in the challenging environments. It can be applied in not only seen uncertain scenarios but also those have unseen scene layouts different from the training scenarios. However, the algorithm cannot handle the problem in environments that contain entirely unseen obstacles. In future research, we will address the problem of planning under robot model uncertainty.",learning from demonstration | Neural networks | Planning | Planning under uncertainty | Probabilistic logic | Robot sensing systems | Safety | sampling-based path planning | Trajectory | Uncertainty,0,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Industrial mobile robots drive past workers and obstacles to the assemblers' workstations, pick up workpieces and deliver them to the next free workstation. To ensure reliable production, robots must carefully consider their actions based on the current situation to minimize losses. In order to reason about losses, it is necessary to identify loss scenarios that are likely to arise from the system's situation. In this paper, the authors propose a novel methodology for identifying these likely loss scenarios based on fault injectors. The fault injectors are trained using reinforcement learning. Based on a probability model of disruptive events (faults), the agents learn to destabilize the system by simulating such events. When a chain of these events leads to a loss, a loss scenario is found. The higher the probability of the loss scenario, the higher the reward for the agent. In this way, the fault injectors optimize for maximally likely loss scenarios. After describing the methodology, the authors propose a framework for systematically classifying different types of fault injectors and give advice on how to build them. Finally, the authors demonstrate reinforcement learning-based fault injectors on the path planning of the mobile robot platform Robotino.",fault injection | loss scenarios | reinforcement learning,0,0,,,,undefined,

Consequently, mobile robots need knowledge about the situative risk to make responsible decisions, e.g., when planning a trajectory. In this paper, the authors present a new approach to evaluate these situative risks at runtime. To compute the situative risk, the proposed approach uses multi-agent adversarial reinforcement learning. Unlike the usual approach that uses the self-play mechanism to harden the agents against disturbances, the approach directly uses the self-play to determine the confidence that the system can handle the current situation. Based on the evaluation of the strength of the perceived perturbations, the robot's digital twin calibrates the action space of the adversarial agents. In this way, the adversarial agents represent the disturbances that are likely to occur. From the simulation results of the competing agents, the digital twin infers the confidence with which the system can handle the situation. In the event that the system cannot handle the situation and crashes in the simulation, the digital twin calculates the probability that the simulated scenario will occur in reality. To calculate this probability, the authors propose the method of game-theoretic event trees. Combining the probability of an accident scenario with the damage caused by the simulated hazard, the results of situative risk are obtained. The approach is qualitatively evaluated using a case study. In this case study, a industrial mobile robot called Robotino is considered that connects workstations in a matrix production system. The case study shows that the approach is promising.",Industrial Mobile Robot | multi-agent adversarial reinforcement learning | risk estimation | runtime risk assessment | safety | situative risk,0,0,,,,undefined,

One such accelerator is Xilinx's Deep Learning Processor Unit (DPU), designed for FPGA-based systems. However, the limited resource capacity of FPGAs in these edge servers imposes an enormous challenge for such implementation. Recent research has shown a clear trade-off between the 'resources consumed' vs. the 'performance achieved Taking a cue from these findings, we address the problem of efficient implementation of deep learning into the edge computing environment in this paper. The edge server employs FPGAs for executing the deep learning model.

Legibility measures how easily a (human) observer can infer the robot's goal from a robot motion trajectory. When generating such trajectories, existing planners often rely on an observer model that estimates the quality of trajectory candidates. These observer models are frequently hand-crafted or, occasionally, learned from demonstrations. Here, we propose to learn them in a supervised manner using the same data format that is frequently used during the evaluation of aforementioned approaches. We then demonstrate the generality of SLOT-V using a Franka Emika in a simulated manipulation environment. For this, we show that it can learn to closely predict various hand-crafted observer models, i.e., that SLOT-V's hypothesis space encompasses existing handcrafted models. Next, we showcase SLOT-V's ability to generalize by showing that a trained model continues to perform well in environments with unseen goal configurations and/or goal counts. Finally, we benchmark SLOT-V's sample efficiency (and performance) against an existing IRL approach and show that SLOT-V learns better observer models with less data. Combined, these results suggest that SLOT-V can learn viable observer models.

To take advantage of forage resources and improve land productivity, we require knowledge of pastureland growth patterns that is simply unavailable at the state of the art. In this paper, we propose to deploy a team of robots to monitor the evolution of an unknown pastureland environment to fulfill the above goal. To monitor such an environment, which usually evolves slowly, we need to design a strategy for rapid assessment of the environment over large areas at a low cost. Thus, we propose an integrated pipeline comprising data synthesis, deep neural network training, and prediction along with a multi-robot deployment algorithm that monitors pasturelands intermittently. Specifically, using expert-informed agricultural data coupled with novel data synthesis in ROS Gazebo, we first propose a new neural network architecture to learn the spatiotemporal dynamics of the environment. Such predictions help us to understand pastureland growth patterns on large scales and make appropriate monitoring decisions for the future. Based on our predictions, we then design an intermittent multi-robot deployment policy for low-cost monitoring. Finally, we compare the proposed pipeline with other methods, from data synthesis to prediction and planning, to corroborate our pipeline&#x2019;s performance. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;Pasturelands are an integral part of agricultural production in the United States.

Firstly, a state vector representing different layers is defined to layer the targets with different priorities, and the switching conditions between layers are given. Secondly, a unified hierarchical state representation and hierarchical reward function are defined for all targets, which can change automatically on the basis of the hierarchical state vector.

The robot needs to use its limited resources to learn its terrain traversability model on the go; however, reusing a provided model is still a desirable option. In a team of heterogeneous robots, the models assessing traversability cannot be reused directly since robots might possess different morphology or sensory equipment and thus experience the terrain differently.

Although multi-robot systems offer increased reliability via redundancy and enable the execution of more challenging missions, engineering these systems is very complex. This complexity affects not only the architecture modelling of the robotic team but also the modelling and analysis of the collaborative intelligence enabling the team to complete its mission. Existing approaches for the development of multi-robot applications do not provide a systematic mechanism for capturing these aspects and assessing the robustness of multi-robot systems. We address this gap by introducing ATLAS, a novel model-driven approach supporting the systematic design space exploration and robustness analysis of multi-robot systems in simulation. The ATLAS domain-specific language enables modelling the architecture of the robotic team and its mission and facilitates the specification of the team’s intelligence.

However, using language is seldom an easy task when humans need to express their intent towards robots, since most of the current language interfaces require rigid templates with a static set of action targets and commands. In this work, we provide a flexible language-based interface for human-robot collaboration, which allows a user to reshape existing trajectories for an autonomous agent. We take advantage of recent advancements in the field of large language models (BERT and CLIP) to encode the user command, and then combine these features with trajectory information using multi-modal attention transformers. We train the model using imitation learning over a dataset containing robot trajectories modified by language commands, and treat the trajectory generation process as a sequence prediction problem, analogously to how language generation architectures operate. We evaluate the system in multiple simulated trajectory scenarios, and show a significant performance increase of our model over baseline approaches. In addition, our real-world experiments with a robot arm show that users significantly prefer our natural language interface over traditional methods such as kinesthetic teaching or cost-function programming. Our study shows how the field of robotics can take advantage of large pre-trained language models towards creating more intuitive interfaces between robots and machines.

The heuristic search algorithm is analyzed and introduced, and A is chosen. A two-dimensional spatial environment model of picking robot path planning is investigated, and a spatial model of picking robot path planning is established by raster method. Then, considering the whole day operation time, the whole day operation time is divided into several periods. With the help of heuristic search algorithm, the most reasonable operation time interval of each period is found, so as to provide reliable reference for the decision-making organization of urban rail transit operation on how to arrange the train rationally. The experimental results show that the improved A∗ algorithm can significantly improve the moving path of the picking robot and make the planned path smoother, which confirms the feasibility and superiority of the improved algorithm. The operation decision of urban rail transit is obtained through experiments. After 114 iterations of the heuristic search algorithm, the optimal value is 6.83353635e-001, while the average optimal value is 6.83551939e-001. After 231 iterations of particle swarm optimization algorithm, the optimal value is 6.83650785e-001. The average optimal value is 6.83745935e-001. After 789 iterations, the genetic algorithm obtains the optimal value of 6.83921100e-001, and the average optimal value is 6.84410765e-001. Through the comparative analysis, it can be seen that compared with the other two optimization algorithms, the heuristic search algorithm is significantly better than the other two optimization algorithms, both in terms of the optimal value and the number of optimization iterations. The results show that the heuristic search algorithm is a fast, accurate, and reliable optimization method to solve the problem of accurate scheduling of urban rail transit departure interval.

In this paper, a probabilistic deep meta-learning approach is proposed to model the existing uncertainty in the driving energy consumption and efficiently adapt the probabilistic predictions based on a small number of local measurements. The method expands upon an existing deterministic deep-meta learning model that, in contrast, only provided single-point energy estimates. The performance of the proposed method is compared against the deterministic approach in a 3D-body dynamic simulator over several typologies of deformable terrains and unstructured geometries.

In this paper, we present an approach to learn a contact-rich peg-in-hole assembly task utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and a compliant robot controller. The DRL-Agent learns directly in the Cartesian space (task space) and not in the joint space of the robot, to increase the robustness and efficiency of the algorithms. To further increase the robustness of the policy and to shorten training times, geometric limitations are imposed by introducing an admissible workspace using a trajectory generator. Furthermore, these limitations result in nearly identical behavior in the simulation and on the real robot, allowing the DRL training process to be purely simulative. The learned policy is experimentally investigated both in the simulation environment and on a real robot, to evaluate its transferability from simulation to reality (sim2real).",,0,0,,,,undefined,

To address this challenge we propose a compositional technique which leverages neural networks to quickly plan and control a robot through crowded and dynamic environments using only intermittent information. Specifically, our tool uses reachability analysis and potential fields to train a neural network that is capable of generating safe control actions. We demonstrate our technique both in simulation with an underwater vehicle crossing a crowded shipping channel and with real experiments with ground vehicles in communication-and sensor-limited environments.",,1,0,repositoryam,Green,ONR,N00014-17-1-2012,Office of Naval Research

In this paper, we propose a robust and safe trajectory optimization algorithm through solving a constrained min-max optimal control problem. The proposed method leverages a game theoretic differential dynamic programming approach with barrier states to handle parametric and nonparametric uncertainties in safety-critical control systems. Barrier states are embedded into the differential game's dynamics and cost to portray the constrained environment in a higher dimensional state space and certify the safety of the optimized trajectory. Moreover, to find a convergent optimal solution, we propose to perform line-search in a Stackleberg (leader-follower) game fashion instead of picking a constant learning rate. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a velocity-constrained inverted pendulum model in a moderate and high parametric uncertainties to show its efficacy in such a comprehensible system.

Their deployment in real-time applications, however, requires highly parallel and capable computing platforms like GPUs to achieve high-speed inference, consuming a large amount of energy. In this paper, we explore a custom deep learning accelerator on an off-the-shelf hybrid FPGA device to achieve similar inference performance at a fraction of the energy consumption. We evaluate different optimisations at bit-level, data-path and training using a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network as our baseline model to arrive at our custom precision quantised deep learning model, which is implemented using the FINN compiler from Xilinx. The accelerator, deployed on a Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ FPGA, achieves a significant reduction in power consumption (≈ 17×), sub 2 ms decoding latency and a near-identical decoding accuracy (statistically insignificant reduction of 2.5% average) as the reported baseline subject-specific classification accuracy on an N (= 54) subject motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) dataset compared to the Deep CNN model on GPU, making our approach more appealing for low-power real-time BCI applications.

To improve the overall trajectory performance, a special motion planning method based on DMPs (Dynamic Movement Primitives) and the modified obstacle-avoiding algorithm is proposed. The proposed method solves the problems of trajectory jitter and inability to avoid obstacles in some scenarios, which are faced by the scheme of steering angle. Besides, it improves the retention of teaching intentions, reduces the loss of free space, and helps the system adapt to the dynamic environment. At the theoretical level, the convergence of the target state has been proved using Lyapunov stability theory-based analysis. The availability of the proposed method is validated and analyzed by performing a series of numerical simulations and Baxter robot experiments. The results indicate that the proposed method can provide reliable solutions for motion planning. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;From the perspective of demonstration learning, this paper aims to elevate the motion planning of the manipulator in task space, especially in improving the obstacle avoidance performance. The existing DMPs-based motion planning algorithm uses the scheme of steering angle to achieve obstacle avoidance, and the obstacle is regarded as a mesh of points on the boundary. The obstacle-avoiding performance is limited. How to combine the obstacle-avoiding algorithm with the DMPs-based motion planning algorithm more effectively, so as to simultaneously achieve retaining teaching intentions as much as possible, still faces challenges. This paper designs a modified obstacle-avoiding algorithm, which solves the problems of trajectory jitter and inability to avoid obstacles in some circumstances, and improves the retention of teaching intentions. The modified obstacle-avoiding algorithm is also applied to the dynamic environment.

In contrast to the YARP Python API, the proposed interface is specialized for the requirements of neural network models and encapsulates the interaction with the robot. The interface capabilities are shown by a simple demonstration where the iCub moves his arm along a given trajectory which can be interrupted by an obstacle. We also provide some insight into the performance considering two important tasks: image processing and joint motion, by comparing our interface implementation with the Python API provided for YARP.",Humanoid robots | iCub | Network interface | Neuro-computing | Neuro-robotics | Software,0,0,,,DFG,416228727 – SFB 1410,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Due to the limitations of outdoor traffic rules and the scale of the environment, the methods for the indoor environment are difficult to apply to the transportation environment. Aiming at exploration in the transportation environment, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on Scenario IMagination(SIM), which has two important components: 1) a mid-level action space, which combines the classical robot control algorithm, addressing the inefficient learning and unstable navigation of deep reinforcement learning algorithms in automatic exploration. With this action space, the deep reinforcement learning algorithm achieves excellent exploration performance in both normal scale environments and large-scale branchless environments; 2) a scenarios buffer, which relieves hard exploration problems of deep reinforcement learning due to serious imbalances of samples in large-scale multibranch scenarios.

In contrast to other works, we use several abstraction layers to generate such commands with as little user input as possible. For this, we use a body-attached multi-sensor setup consisting of a pressure band, a smart glove, EMG and IMU units. Their combined signals define a multi-dimensional vector per time step. We use a Recurrent Neural Network to infer the gesture class from the pre-processed data stream. From these user inputs we generate a set of symbolic spatial relations describing the assembly process. This formal description is then used to select and execute robot skills such as grasping. Hence, we reduce the ambiguity of abstract instructions in several steps and allow for effective gesture-based robot programming. In our work we give insights in defining and detecting such gestures.

Considering that most construction robots are not fully automated and require extra guidance and instructions from the operators, an autonomous way for robots to understand how to execute specific construction tasks is needed. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a possible solution to this problem. Instead of explicitly detailing the solution to a problem, RL algorithms enable a robot to autonomously discover an optimal behavior through trial-and-error interactions with its environment. It constructs a learning model to solve various sequential decision-making problems. RL algorithms could help construction robots establish a learning process based on the feedback from the construction site and lead to an optimal strategy to finish the sequential construction work. Nowadays, on-site construction robots still require tedious work in preprogramming. Many other areas have used RL algorithms on different tasks, such as dexterous manipulation, legged locomotion, or pathing planning; thus, there is great potential for combining construction robot applications with RL algorithms. Despite these achievements, most works investigated single-agent settings only. However, many real-world applications naturally comprise multiple decision-makers that interact simultaneously, such as traffic modeling for autonomous vehicles and networking communication packages for multi-robot control. These applications have faced significant challenges when dealing with such high-dimensional environments, not to mention the challenges for the on-site construction robots. The recent development of deep learning has enabled RL methods to drive optimal policies for a sophisticated high-dimensional environment. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no extensive survey of the applications of RL techniques within the construction industry. This study can inspire future research into how best to integrate powerful RL algorithms to achieve a higher-level autonomous control of construction robots and overcome resource planning, risk management, and logistic challenges in the industry.",Construction robot | Deep reinforcement learning | Multi-agent | Path planning | Task allocation,0,0,,,,undefined,

A practical example can be seen in the robots commonly employed in warehouses: they must navigate to pick up goods and move them to certain locations. Therefore, the robot needs a method of moving from an initial location in the warehouse to a final location repeatedly. In this paper, we propose a technique that allows a robot to path plan in generalized environments, from different starting and goal locations. The method is based on a graph representation of the environment, and is capable of finding the shortest path between two points in the environment.

In order to build a robotic agent with path-following skills, this paper proposes a visual path–following algorithm based on artificial intelligence deep reinforcement learning double deep Q-network (DDQN). The proposed approach allows the robot to learn path-following skill by itself, using a visual sensor in the Robot Operating System (ROS) simulation environment. The robot can learn paths with different textures, colors, and shapes, which enhances the flexibility for different industrial robot application scenarios. Skills acquired in simulation can be directly translated to the real world. In order to verify the performance of the path-following skill, a path randomly hand-drawn on the workpiece is tested by the six-joint robot Universal Robots 5 (UR5).

An alternative for fast online execution is to train, offline, an information gathering policy, which indirectly reasons about the information value of new observations. However, these policies lack safety guarantees and do not account for the robot dynamics. To overcome these limitations we train an information-aware policy via deep reinforcement learning, that guides a receding-horizon trajectory optimization planner. In particular, the policy continuously recommends a reference viewpoint to the local planner, such that the resulting dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories lead to observations that maximize the information gain and reduce the uncertainty about the environment. In simulation tests in previously unseen environments, our method consistently outperforms greedy next-best-view policies and achieves competitive performance compared to Monte Carlo Tree Search, in terms of information gains and coverage time, with a reduction in execution time by three orders of magnitude.",,2,0,repositoryam,Green,,18165,

BLIND utilizes inverse reinforcement learning to derive motion-level guidance from human critiques. The algorithm overcomes the computational challenge of reward learning for high-DOF robots by projecting the robot's continuous configuration space to a motion-planner-guided discrete task model. The learned reward is in turn used as guidance to generate robot motion using a novel motion planner.

Therefore, we propose a shielding mechanism that ensures ISO- verified human safety while training and deploying RL algorithms on manipulators. We utilize a fast reachability analysis of humans and manipulators to guarantee that the manipulator comes to a complete stop before a human is within its range.

To address this limitation, we propose (FIRE), a framework that extracts local representations of planning problems and learns a similarity function over them. To generate the training data we introduce a novel self-supervised method that identifies similar and dissimilar pairs of local primitives from past solution paths. With these pairs, a Siamese network is trained with the contrastive loss and the similarity function is realized in the network's latent space. We evaluate FIRE on an 8-DOF manipulator in five categories of motion planning problems with sensed environments.

Many multinational tech companies and startups are developing a truly autonomous vehicle that will guarantee the safety and security of the passengers and other vehicles, pedestrians on roads, and roadside structures such as traffic signal poles, traffic signposts, and other structures. However, these autonomous vehicles have not been implemented on a large scale for regular use on roads currently. These autonomous vehicles perform many different object detection/recognition tasks. Examples include traffic sign recognition, lane detection, pedestrian detection. Usually, the person driving the vehicle performs these detection/recognition tasks. The main goal of such autonomous systems should be to perform these tasks in real-time. Deep learning performs these object recognition tasks with very high accuracy. The neural network is implemented on the hardware device, which does all the computation work. Different vendors have many different hardware choices that suit the client's needs. Usually, these neural networks are implemented on a CPU, DSP, GPU, FPGA, and other custom-made AI-specific hardware. The underlying processor forms a vital part of an ADAS. The CNN needs to process the incoming frames from a camera for real-time object detection/recognition tasks. Real-time processing is necessary to take appropriate actions/decisions depending on the logic embedded. Hence knowing the performance of the neural network (in terms of frames processed per second) on the underlying hardware is a significant factor in deciding the various hardware options available from different vendors, which CNN model to implement, whether the CNN model is suitable to implement on the underlying hardware depending upon the system specifications and requirement.

Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that has increased in popularity in mobile robot path planning in recent times, due to its self-learning capability without requiring a priori model of the environment. However, Q-learning shows slow convergence to the optimal solution, notwithstanding such an advantage. To address this limitation, the concept of partially guided Q-learning is employed wherein, the artificial potential field (APF) method is utilized to improve the classical Q-learning approach. Therefore, the proposed QAPF learning algorithm for path planning can enhance learning speed and improve final performance using the combination of Q-learning and the APF method. Criteria used to measure planning effectiveness include path length, path smoothness, and learning time. Experiments demonstrate that the QAPF algorithm successfully achieves better learning values that outperform the classical Q-learning approach in all the test environments presented in terms of the criteria mentioned above in offline and online path planning modes. The QAPF learning algorithm reached an improvement of 18.83% in path length for the online mode, an improvement of 169.75% in path smoothness for the offline mode, and an improvement of 74.84% in training time over the classical approach.",artificial potential field | mobile robots | Path planning | Q-learning | reinforcement learning,18,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

The proposed 2-level PQ-management evaluates initial load scheduling plans, based on available RE and storage sources. System efficiency and failure-free operations are planned considering the first estimate of its day-ahead PVP supply and secondary PQ verification of the provided load utilization schemes, under various state charges and RE production limits. This is a novelty with a notable incremental improvement in the published combinatorial optimization algorithms, only scheduling applicable load components, and reassessing the allowable power-day resources. Off-grid optimal operations can be determined and regulated by an adequate early morning PQ evaluation in RE utilization. A C++ parametric software, using differential learning to evolve PQ-models, historical PQ & meteo-data sets are at disposal to enable additional comparisons with the presented models.",,2,0,,,TACR,SGS2022/12,Technology Agency of the Czech Republic

Multi-robot systems, in particular, have the potential to revolutionize multiple industries-such as transportation and home care-where safety guarantees are a primary requirement. A known challenge for swarms and multi-robot systems is the gap between requirements and design, due to the need to translate swarm-level objectives into robot-level behaviors. In this paper, we focus on a less studied problem-the gap between requirements and implementation. As a case study, we use Buzz, that is a dynamic programming language designed for swarm robotics applications. Similarly to Python, Lua, and JavaScript, Buzz does not natively offer formal guarantees of correctness or safety. We propose an approach to automatically extract' as-implemented' models from Buzz programs, whose properties can then be formally analyzed and verified. Results obtained from the experiments performed on two medium-size open-source production-level systems for robotics research have also been reported.

These commercially available platforms are relatively cheap and straightforward, yet robust enough to operate continuously in a dynamic environment. Their simplicity and robustness make them particularly suitable for the application in an elderly care context. Although the technology used on these robotic platforms has evolved considerably in recent years, these tools are meant to have no or minimal autonomy and are, hence, mostly relegated to provide pure telepresence services for video calls between the older users and their carers. This work aims to lay the foundations to increase the autonomy of mobile telepresence robots, both by supporting teleoperation through shared approaches and offering services to users in total autonomy. To this purpose, different artificial intelligence technologies such as Reasoning, Knowledge Representation, Automated Planning, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Advanced Perception and Navigation must coexist on limited hardware. An architecture aiming to integrate these technologies is proposed together with backbone services that integrate classical and innovative AI with robotics. Additionally, the problems that arise from the integration of heterogeneous technologies such as plan adaptation needs, shared navigation challenges and the generation of data-driven models able to run on not-performant hardware, are presented along with possible solutions exemplified on the older users assistance domain.",Active ageing | Enhanced telepresence | Planning and execution | Robotics and perception,0,0,,,,undefined,

Since unmanned vehicles are intended to work in an environment without any conduction, finding a collision-free path of movement is of paramount importance and a definite asset in practice. The objective of a global path planner consists in generating an optimized path without considering unknown obstacles. In contrast, a local path planner properly avoids the unknown obstacles while getting close to the goal. This results in an inefficient movement, particularly in complex circumstances. In this paper, a complete global and local path planning method is proposed for avoiding both static and dynamic obstacles. The proposed method benefits the advantages of both approaches while covering each other's weaknesses. First, a method for generating numerous obstacle-free paths from random pairs of start and goal points is introduced. Next, a novel deep-learning approach is proposed in order to train the robot in an environment free of moving obstacles. After extracting the desired via points, an efficient Artificial Potential Field (APF) approach for attaining the local path planning is introduced with the aim of avoiding dynamic obstacles while the robot travels through the aforementioned via points. The proposed method can be well extended to different platforms such as mobile robots, arm robots, quadrotors, etc; in this paper, both local and global path planning methods are implemented on a simulated quadrotor to examine the robot's performance for both approaches. Furthermore, it has been revealed that implementing both approaches should be implemented seamlessly in order to attain a complete efficient path planning with the presence of both static and dynamic obstacles. Finally, both local and global path planning methods are implemented on a detailed simulated quadrotor to evaluate the robot's performance for the aforementioned approaches.",Artificial Potential field | Deep learning | Global and local Path Planning | Robot Path Planning | Static and Dynamics Obstacles avoidance,1,0,,,,undefined,

Routing approaches for deformable objects which rely on learned implicit spatial representations (e.g., Learning-from-Demonstration methods) make them vulnerable to changes in the environment and the specific setup. On the other hand, algorithms that entirely separate the spatial representation of the deformable object from the routing and manipulation, often using a representation approach independent of planning, result in slow planning in high dimensional space. This paper proposes a novel approach to routing deformable one-dimensional objects (e.g., wires, cables, ropes, sutures, threads). This approach utilizes a compact representation for the object, allowing efficient and fast online routing. The spatial representation is based on the geometrical decomposition of the space into convex subspaces, resulting in a discrete coding of the deformable object configuration as a sequence. With such a configuration, the routing problem can be solved using a fast dynamic programming sequence matching method that calculates the next routing move. The proposed method couples the routing and efficient configuration for improved planning time. Our simulation and real experiments show the method correctly computing the next manipulation action in sub-millisecond time and accomplishing various routing and manipulation tasks.",,1,0,repositoryam,Green,CMU,undefined,Carnegie Mellon University

This paper introduces a novel approach to collaborative localization for dense scene reconstruction in heterogeneous multi-robot systems comprising ground robots and micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs). We solve the problem of full relative pose estimation without sliding time windows by relying on UWB-based ranging and Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO)-based egomotion estimation for localization, while exploiting lidars onboard the ground robots for full relative pose estimation in a single reference frame. During operation, the rigidity eigenvalue provides feedback to the system. To tackle the challenge of path planning and obstacle avoidance of MAVs in GNSS-denied environments, we maintain line-of-sight between ground robots and MAVs.

The temporal plan is decomposed into low-level plans for individual robots. At the low-level, we perform online learning and adaptation due to unexpected probabilistic outcomes to achieve mission goals. Our framework learns over time to improve the performance by (1) updating the learned domain model to reduce model prediction errors and (2) constraining the robot's capabilities which in turn improves goal allocation.

Furthermore, a platform is required that allows the coexistence of DNN applications and other applications, including conventional real-time control soft-ware, to enable advanced embedded systems, such as self-driving systems.

This decision-making process needs a series of non-dominated solutions, which enables to reduce the range of solutions for final implementation. This paper is focused on the path-relinking method exploitation to find a good approximation of the Pareto front of the emergency medical system designs. As the path-relinking method itself is able to inspect only one short path in the surface of a unit hypercube, the method must be embedded into a more sophisticated searching process. We present here a learning algorithm, which adaptively choices pair of input solutions for a single path-relinking method run. The learning algorithm also sets weights of the conflicting criteria to define composed objective function used in the control process of the path-relinking method. The complete searching process was tested on several real-sized benchmarks and the resulting sets of non-dominated solutions are compared to the exact Pareto fronts.

This paper proposes a reflective reward design method based on potential energy function, and combines the ideas of multi-agent and multi-task learning to form a new training framework. The reflective reward represents the quality of the agent's current decision relative to the past historical decision sequence, using the second-order information of the historical reward sequence. The policy or value function update of the master agent is then assisted by the reflective agent. The method proposed in this paper can easily extend the existing deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on value function and policy gradient, and then form a new learning method, so that the agent has the reflective characteristics in human learning after making full use of the reward information. It is good at distinguishing the optimal action in the corresponding state. Experiments in pathfinding scenarios verify the effectiveness of the algorithm in sparse reward scenarios. Compared with other algorithms, the deep reinforcement learning algorithm has higher exploration success rate and stability. Experiments in survival scenarios verify the improvement effect of the reward feature enhancement method based on the auxiliary task learning mechanism on the original algorithm. Simulation experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for solving the path planning problem of mobile robots in dynamic environments and the superiority of deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The simulation results show that the algorithm can accurately avoid unknown obstacles and reach the target point, and the planned path is the shortest and the energy consumed by the robot is the least.

Most prior work in these domains has examined smaller programs that are usually simple and fit a single screen. However, real block-based programs often grow larger and, because end-users are unlikely to break them down into separate functions, they often become unwieldy. In our study, we introduce a function-centric block-based environment to help end-users write programs that require a large number of blocks. Through a user study with 92 users, we evaluated our approach and found that while users could successfully complete smaller tasks with and without our approach, they were both quicker and more successful with our function-centric method when tackling larger tasks. This work demonstrates that adding scaffolding can encourage the systematic use of functions, enabling end-users to write larger programs with block-based programming environments, which can contribute to the solution of more complex tasks in applied domains.",,0,0,,,NSF,NRI-2024561,National Science Foundation

An example of such a system is a system that automates processes in higher education institutions. Ontological engineering is the process of designing and developing ontologies that combines two main technologies for designing complex cyber-physical systems-object-oriented and structural analysis. The goals of ontological engineering are to increase the level of integration of information necessary for making management decisions, increase the efficiency of information retrieval, and provide an opportunity for joint processing of knowledge based on a single semantic description of the knowledge space. Ontological engineering is carried out within the framework of the proposed approach to managing complex cyber-physical systems. The resulting ontology should be a convenient and flexible basis for modeling processes and ensuring the functioning of information and analytical processes in a complex system. Approaches to ontological engineering based on graphs are considered. The application of ordinary graphs, hypergraphs and metagraphs is described. The use of metagraphs in the construction of hierarchical ontologies has been substantiated. Metagraphs are considered as the basis for building an applied system ontology. A modification of the metagraph is proposed to include events and system methods in the ontology. This approach to the construction of a metagraph allows to include the process component in the ontological model of the system as an integral part of it, which allows to flexibly and with lower time expenses form process models based on segments of the general ontological model. An example of the implementation of a software-instrumental environment for ontological engineering and further construction of models of processes of a complex cyber-physical system is presented. The technology used to implement the ontological model in the database and the structure of the database for storing the ontology are described.",cyber-physical systems | graph | hypergraph | metagraph | ontological engineering | ontology,1,0,,,,undefined,

Epilepsy acts as a condition with inconsistent symptoms involving spasmodic abnormal electrical activities in the brain. Clinical data pertinent to such abnormalities is nonlinear, non-stationary, and multi-dimensional. The processing and analysis of such data generates a combination of computing research challenges. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the most clinically and scientifically utilized signals recorded from human brain. It is a powerful source for providing valuable insight of the brain dynamics. Accurate and careful analyses of EEG signals play a prominent role in diagnosis of brain disorders such as epilepsy. EEG signal has exceptional temporal resolution, usability, and non-invasive recording set-up with low costs which makes it popular in the field of biomedical research. Currently, trained neurologists take diagnostic decision by observing EEG recordings visually to decide probable treatment plan. The visual inspection of non-stationary and high-dimensional EEG recordings is a time-consuming task and results in errors. An automated seizure detector is an essential system not only for the better understanding of seizure generation but also a boon for medical professionals who are subjected to fatigue in visualizing a continuous and enormous long-term recording. The multichannel automated seizure detection is a bulky system as it involves recording from at least 16 channels. The use of such system on subjects who are remotely located is a challenge. In this paper, a unique embedded system based on envelop generation technique while sifting of EEG signals by Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) has been proposed to classify seizure signals. The modifications in the algorithm have resulted in an equivalent performance on multivariate signals when compared to simulation results. The use of 5-channel EMOTIV® headset and Raspberry Pi embedded system using python programming language has resulted in classification accuracy of 88.6% on multivariate signals.

We report the following findings: 1) Three types of rules between design units were identified with visual artifact analysis: latent, generic, and domain-specific rules; 2) two types of CSCL artifacts (technology and discussions) were intertwined and developed in parallel, along with a computer-based scaffolding scenario that offloads domain-specific scaffolding from humans to computers.",Block-based programming | computer-supported collaborative learning | domain-oriented design environment | human-centered artificial intelligence | knowledge-based rules | physical computing in education,6,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

In some cases, this machine learning approach can save programmers time, outperform existing controllers, reach super-human performance, and continually adapt to changing conditions. It has shown human level performance on a number of tasks (REF) and the methodology for automation in robotics and self-driving cars (REF). This book argues that these successes show reinforcement learning can be adopted successfully in many different situations, including robot control, stock trading, supply chain optimization, and plant control. However, reinforcement learning has traditionally been limited to applications in virtual environments or simulations in which the setup is already provided. Furthermore, experimentation may be completed for an almost limitless number of attempts risk-free. In many real-life tasks, applying reinforcement learning is not as simple as (1) data is not in the correct form for reinforcement learning; (2) data is scarce, and (3) automation has limitations in the real-world. Therefore, this book is written to help academics, domain specialists, and data enthusiast alike to understand the basic principles of applying reinforcement learning to real-world problems. This is achieved by focusing on the process of taking practical examples and modeling standard data into the correct form required to then apply basic agents. To further assist readers gain a deep and grounded understanding of the approaches, the book shows hand-calculated examples in full and then how this can be achieved in a more automated manner with code. For decision makers who are interested in reinforcement learning as a solution but are not proficient, the book includes simple, non-technical examples in the introduction and case studies section. These provide context of what reinforcement learning offer but also the challenges and risks associated with applying it in practice. Specifically, these sections illustrate the differences between reinforcement learning and other machine learning approaches as well as how well-known companies have found success using the approach to their problems.",applied RL | case studies | commercial applications | dynamic programming | practical RL in Python | real-world data | reinforcement learning,0,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,

Dynamic window approach (DWA) is a flexible way to solve this task, however its evaluation functions are not comprehensive enough and the weight of these functions will not be adjusted with the change of environment in real time, which makes the robot tend to circumnavigate the outside of the dense obstacle area, and it is easy to fall into the failure of the evaluation function when it meets the combination of “C” shaped obstacles. In this paper, an improved DWA based on Q-learning is proposed. Firstly, we add a new evaluation function to prevent the robot from circling in place. Then, on the basis of defining the state space, action space and reward function in the robot motion planning, Q-learning is used to adjust the weight of the evaluation function adaptively, so that it can adapt to the changing environment.

Disassembly, as a key step in remanufacturing, has been attracted much attention in recent years. To make up for the deficiency of manual disassembly which is low efficiency and high cost, industry robots have great advantages in handling large volume and repeatable disassembly activities. Besides, proper disassembly sequence planning helps to improve the disassembly efficiency. In this paper, the framework of robotic disassembly sequence planning using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed to solve robotic disassembly sequence planning (RDSP) problem. Considering the smoothness of starting and stopping in robotic movement, dynamic moving speed model is built for moving time in disassembly. Firstly, a disassembly precedence matrix (DPM) is constructed according to the structure of disassembly products. After that, RDSP is modeled as Markov decision process and the state, action and reward of the agent in DRL environment are designed. The deep reinforcement learning network model is trained to obtain the optimal disassembly sequence in RDSP. Finally, case study based on double coupling shaft with 21 components proves that the DRL algorithm used in this paper can obtain a disassembly sequence for better performance compared with other two meta-heuristic methods.",deep reinforcement learning | disassembly sequence planning | dynamic moving speed | remanufacturing | robotic disassembly,1,0,,,,undefined,

This gave the students an opportunity to build projects for real time applications. Students were actively engaged through a course project which necessitated them to write assembly programs [21].

We decided to be the first working group in Slovakia that create a project to implement the innovation at national level education by using physical computing principles to develop student's digital skills. In cooperation with Slovak mobile company, we have realized the project, focused on education with the BBC micro:bit in Slovak schools. Thanks to the project teachers could have not only hardware but also access to information they needed to start teaching with BBC micro:bit. It helped to eliminate the problems with how to start and teachers could focus on the students. After teaching with micro:bit teachers were more motivated and confident. Based on the post-questionnaire, we found that computer science teachers perceive their competencies higher than before the start of the project.",competencies | education | micro:bit | microcontroller | programming,2,0,,,,undefined,

In this study, we develop a lightweight reinforcement learning method for real-time gait planning of the biped robot. We regard bipedal walking as a process in which the robot constantly interacts with the environment, judges the quality of control action through the walking state, and then adjusts the control strategy. A mean-asynchronous advantage actor-critic (M-A3C) reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to obtain the continuous state space and action space, and directly obtain the final gait of the robot without introducing the reference gait. We use multiple sub-agents of M-A3C algorithm to train multiple virtual robots independently at the same time in the physical simulation platform. Then we transfer the trained model to the walking control of the actual robot to reduce the number of training on the actual robot, improve the training speed, and ensure the acquisition of the final gait. Finally, a biped robot is designed and fabricated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Various experiments show that the proposed method can achieve the biped robot's continuous and stable gait planning.",actor-critic learning | Biped robot | machine intelligence,5,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

In this paper, an optimal collision-free algorithm is designed and implemented practically based on an improved Dijkstra algorithm. To achieve this research objectives, first, the MR obstacle-free environment is modeled as a diagraph including nodes, edges and weights. Second, Dijkstra algorithm is used offline to generate the shortest path driving the MR from a starting point to a target point. During its movement, the robot should follow the previously obtained path and stop at each node to test if there is an obstacle between the current node and the immediately following node. For this aim, the MR was equipped with an ultrasonic sensor used as obstacle detector. If an obstacle is found, the MR updates its diagraph by excluding the corresponding node. Then, Dijkstra algorithm runs on the modified diagraph. This procedure is repeated until reaching the target point. To verify the efficiency of the proposed approach, a simulation was carried out on a hand-made MR and an environment including 9 nodes, 19 edges and 2 obstacles. The obtained optimal path avoiding obstacles has been transferred into motion control and implemented practically using line tracking sensors. This study has shown that the improved Dijkstra algorithm can efficiently solve optimal path planning in environments including obstacles and that STEAM-based MRs are efficient cost-effective tools to practically implement the designed algorithm.",improved dijkstra algorithm | Mobile robot (MR) | obstacle avoidance | path planning | STEAM,10,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

Although state-of-the-art hierarchical robot planning algorithms allow robots to efficiently compute long-horizon motion plans for achieving user desired tasks, these methods typically rely upon environment-dependent state and action abstractions that need to be hand-designed by experts. We present a new approach for bootstrapping the entire hierarchical planning process. This allows us to compute abstract states and actions for new environments automatically using the critical regions predicted by a deep neural network with an auto-generated robot-specific architecture. We show that the learned abstractions can be used with a novel multi-source bi-directional hierarchical robot planning algorithm that is sound and probabilistically complete. An extensive empirical evaluation on twenty different settings using holonomic and non-holonomic robots shows that (a) our learned abstractions provide the information necessary for efficient multi-source hierarchical planning; and that (b) this approach of learning, abstractions, and planning outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by nearly a factor of ten in terms of planning time on test environments not seen during training.","Deep Learning, Hierarchical Planning | Learning Abstractions for Planning | Learning for Motion Planning | Motion Planning",4,0,,,NSF,1909370,National Science Foundation

Reinforcement learning is consistently showing remarkable results in learning effective action policies and in achieving super-human performance in various tasks – without exploiting prior knowledge. However, in robotics, the use of purely learning-based techniques is still subject to strong limitations. Foremost, sample efficiency. Such techniques, in fact, are known to require large training datasets, and long training sessions, in order to develop effective action policies. Hence in this paper, to alleviate such constraint, and to allow learning in such robotic scenarios, we introduce SErP (Sample Efficient robot Policies), an iterative algorithm to improve the sample-efficiency of learning algorithms. SErP exploits a sub-optimal planner (here implemented with a monitor-replanning algorithm) to lead the exploration of the learning agent through its initial iterations. Intuitively, SErP exploits the planner as an expert in order to enable focused exploration and to avoid portions of the search space that are not effective to solve the task of the robot. Finally, to confirm our insights and to show the improvements that SErP carries with, we report the results obtained in two different robotic scenarios: (1) a cartpole scenario and (2) a soccer-robots scenario within the RoboCup@Soccer SPL environment.",Automated planning | Decision-making | Reinforcement learning,0,0,,,,undefined,

A robust and efficient Synchronous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system is essential for autonomous movement of robots.

At the same time, because of its importance in pattern recognition, deep learning has a relatively mature theoretical foundation and practical framework for feature extraction. In this paper, we propose a visual SLAM system based on deep features in dynamic scenes, which combines mature convolutional neural networks (CNNs) HF-Net into an existing SLAM system. First, use HF-Net to detect the input image, and give local descriptors and global descriptors of the image. Then, these descriptors are used by different modules of the SLAM system. Because the features are not obtained by hand, they are very robust to scene changes. In loop closure detection, a distributed bag-of-words (DBoW) is used to form a vocabulary table, and local and global features are all considered at the same time, so the performance is more reliable.

In the process of research on heterogeneous multicore processor systems, system task scheduling is particularly important. A good task scheduling algorithm can give full play to system performance. In this paper, the intelligent approximation algorithm is applied to the task scheduling problem of heterogeneous multicore processor system, and the heterogeneous multicore processor system is obtained as a highlight in the multicore processor system. Relying on the characteristics of high efficiency and low cost, it is widely loved by people, and at the same time, it has become the most commonly used processor system in embedded systems. In the process of research on heterogeneous multicore processor systems, the system task scheduling problem is particularly important. A good task scheduling algorithm can give full play to system performance. Some commonly used heuristic task scheduling algorithms are insufficient in solving such problems. This paper combines the granularity-based wavefront parallel decoding algorithm and the fast fusion loop filter algorithm to apply pipeline parallel technology between pixels. Decoding reconstruction module and fast loop filter module realize the fusion of multilevel parallel decoding. Based on the multicore platform, a dynamic multiparallel scheduling algorithm is designed to realize two-way video real-time parallel high-speed decoding, which improves the core resource utilization rate and decoding execution efficiency of the multicore processing platform. This paper also designs an indicator collector, a read-write hit collector, and a cache block priority determiner to implement a dynamic generation strategy with low hardware overhead. Multimodal teaching has certain feasibility and effectiveness and can have a positive impact on the English reading motivation and English reading comprehension ability of university students. Multimodal teaching improves students' English reading comprehension ability, deepens students' understanding and memory of words, and broadens the scope of knowledge, which has a significant promoting effect. The research results show that multimodality can be applied to college English teaching, and it can achieve better results than traditional teaching methods. By comparing the test results before and after the test, there are obvious differences between the experimental class and the control class. Whether it is the paired sample T-test of the experimental class or the independent sample T-test of two teaching methods in two classes, it proves that the scores under the multimodal English teaching mode are higher than the traditional teaching mode. Multimodal classrooms provide students with many opportunities to participate in classroom activities and form a competitive learning atmosphere. This competitive learning atmosphere has become a driving force to promote student learning. Multimodal teaching methods help to cultivate students' independent and cooperative learning. In a multimodal classroom, many activities require cooperation and discussion among students. When they encounter difficulties, they can help each other, discuss with each other, and cooperate to complete tasks. Therefore, the multimodal teaching method will stimulate students' interest in learning, give full play to students' initiative, and improve students' English ability.",,1,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

To improve the efficiency of mobile robot learning and exploration, the Vision Sensor is used to acquire the input data from the environment, and the layer normalization method is used to normalize the input data. An improved reward function is designed, which improves the reward value of the algorithm, optimizes the state space, and alleviates the problem of sparse reward to some extent. The data is stored in a priority experience replay pool, and the network is trained using small batches of data. In addition, we evaluate our method by experiment related to indoor navigation.

Results proved that the examined ALCS are capable of solving selected problems.

The purpose of this paper is to correctly unite the principles of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics in a small size robotic theatre that will allow for a more portable and changeable exhibition. The Tortoise and Hare play will be performed in the theatre, which is made up of both stage and puppet elements. A pan and tilt lighting system, audio integration via an external device, automated curtains with stepper motors, props, and a grid stage are among the stage’s components. A camera tracking module in the light system detects the location of a robot and communicates with the light fixtures to angle the spotlight. A transportable module that interacts wirelessly with its environment, as well as simple-moving, decorative puppet cutouts protruding from the module, make up the smart puppets. The mBlock IDE is used to edit the story in the theatre software, providing for a simple technique of programming the scene.

A robot must handle a flexible object (clothes) and solid objects (buttons) simultaneously during the buttoning task, therefore there is no previous work due to its complexity. We design a strategy of the buttoning task using a dual-arm robot by dividing a series of motions into subtasks with the following methods: (a) a marker-based algorithmic method, markerless machine learning methods (b) without pseudo-rehearsal motions and (c) with pseudo-rehearsal motions. The pseudo-rehearsal is a consolidation learning using generated data by the firstly trained model. We examine the method (a) to make sure if the buttoning task is feasible. For real world setup, markers should not be attached to shirts. Hence, we try to achieve the first half of the task (the button-hooking task) by machine learning methods (b)(c) after we collect dataset via the robotic task with markers (a).

While previous studies have focused on step-by-step instructions, all-at-once teaching allows users to teach the behavior more naturally. However, all-at-once teaching needs to bridge the gap between verbal instruction and robot execution in order to understand which instruction corresponds to which demonstration section. To this end, we introduce the notion of task cohesion, which connects verbal instructions to robot execution based on the concept of physical/semantic state transition. We solve the problem of grounding and over/under-segmentation of language and demonstration by considering the cost of recursive dynamic programming, which divides the demonstration and grounds it to the language. The what-to-do can be obtained from the language, and the how-to-do can be obtained by extracting the parameters necessary for the execution of the robot based on the information of the task cohesion from the demonstration segments where the language is grounded. The contributions of this study are as follows: (1) to introduce task cohesion, (2) to propose a recursive dynamic programming approach to align verbal instructions and human demonstration, and (3) to demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-modal all-at-once teaching by integrating them.",,3,0,,,,undefined,

They are promising for stand-alone and embedded applications in the automotive industry, microcontrollers, Internet of Things, frame buffer memory, and slow SRAM. The MRAM cell usually includes a CoFeB fixed reference layer and a free magnetic layer (FL), separated by a tunnel barrier. To design ultra-scaled MRAM cells it is necessary to accurately model the torques acting on the magnetization in composite magnetic layers with one or several nonmagnetic inclusions between the ferromagnetic parts. The magnetization dynamics is governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation supplemented with the corresponding torques. The torques depend on nonequilibrium spin accumulation generated by an electric current. The electric current and the spin accumulation also depend on the magnetization. Therefore, the LLG and the spin-charge transport equations are coupled and must be solved simultaneously. We apply the finite element method (FEM) to numerically solve this coupled system of partial differential equations. To develop an open source solver, we use well-developed C++ FEM libraries. The computationally most expensive part is the demagnetizing field calculation. It is performed by a hybrid finite element-boundary element method. This confines the simulation domain for the field evaluation to the ferromagnets only. Advanced compression algorithms for large, dense matrices are used to optimize the performance of the demagnetizing field calculation in complex structures. To evaluate the torques acting on the magnetization, a coupled spin and charge transport approach is implemented. For the computation of the torques acting in a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), a magnetization-dependent resistivity of the tunnel barrier is introduced. A fully three-dimensional solution of the equations is performed to accurately model the torques acting on the magnetization. The use of a unique set of equations for the whole memory cell including the FL, fixed layer, contacts, and nonmagnetic spacers is one of the advantages of our approach. To incorporate the temperature increase due to the electric current, we solve the heat transport equation coupled to the electron, spin, and magnetization dynamics, and we demonstrate that the FL temperature is highly inhomogeneous due to a non-uniform magnetization of the FL during switching. Spin-orbit torque (SOT) MRAM is fast-switching and thus well suitable for caches. By means of micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate the purely electrical switching of a perpendicular FL by the SOTs due to two orthogonal short current pulses. To further optimize the pulse sequence, a machine learning approach based on reinforcement learning is employed. Importantly, a neural network trained on a fixed material parameter set achieves switching for a wide range of material parameter variations.",Magnetoresistive random access memories | Spin-orbit torque MRAM | Spin-transfer torque MRAM,1,0,,,CDG,undefined,"Österreichische Nationalstiftung für Forschung, Technologie und Entwicklung"

However, intertwining between CT and ER remains a challenge for teachers. This paper describes a method to expose secondary school children to CT concepts and skills through ER learning activities. The method integrates the four CT core concepts, which are problem analysis and algorithm; abstraction; pattern recognition; and decomposition, in a two days’ ER workshop implementation. The result of the study shows that the method of integrating CT with ER has the potential to nurture students’ CT and programming skills.

In this regard, learning-based motion generations are currently being investigated. However, the main issue has been improvements of the adaptability to spatially varying environments, but a variation of the operating speed has not been investigated in detail. In contact-rich tasks, it is especially important to be able to adjust the operating speed because a nonlinear relationship occurs between the operating speed and force (e.g., inertial and frictional forces), and it affects the results of the tasks. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method for generating variable operating speeds while adapting to spatial perturbations in the environment. The proposed method can be adapted to nonlinearities by utilizing a small amount of motion data. We experimentally evaluated the proposed method by erasing a line using an eraser fixed to the tip of the robot as an example of a contact-rich task. Furthermore, the proposed method enables a robot to perform a task faster than a human operator and is capable of operating close to the control bandwidth.",bilateral control | fast-forward | Imitation learning | machine learning | motion planning,3,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

We propose a μBrain-based scalable many-core neuromorphic hardware design to accelerate the computations of spiking deep convolutional neural networks (SDCNNs). To increase energy efficiency, cores are designed to be heterogeneous in terms of their neuron and synapse capacity (i.e., big vs. little cores), and they are interconnected using a parallel segmented bus interconnect, which leads to lower latency and energy compared to a traditional mesh-based Network-on-Chip (NoC). We propose a system software framework called SentryOS to map SDCNN inference applications to the proposed design. SentryOS consists of a compiler and a run-time manager. The compiler compiles an SDCNN application into sub-networks by exploiting the internal architecture of big and little μBrain cores. The run-time manager schedules these sub-networks onto cores and pipeline their execution to improve throughput. We evaluate the proposed big little many-core neuromorphic design and the system software framework with five commonly-used SDCNN inference applications and show that the proposed solution reduces energy (between 37% and 98%), reduces latency (between 9% and 25%), and increases application throughput (between 20% and 36%).

In this paper, we introduce MoveRL, an environment that exposes a standard OpenAI Gym interface, and allows any off-the-shelf RL agent to control a robot built on ROS, the Robot OS. ROS is the standard abstraction layer used by roboticists, and allows to observe and control both simulated and physical robots. By providing a bridge between the Gym and ROS, our environment allows an easy evaluation of RL algorithms in highly-accurate simulators, or real-world robots, without any change of software. In addition to a Gym-ROS bridge, our environment also leverages MoveIt, a state-of-the-art collision-aware robot motion planner, to prevent the RL agent from executing actions that would lead to a collision. Our experimental results show that a standard PPO agent is able to control a simulated commercial robot arm in an environment with moving obstacles, while almost perfectly avoiding collisions even in the early stages of learning. We also show that the use of MoveIt slightly increases the sample-efficiency of the RL agent. Combined, these results show that RL on robots is possible in a safe way, and that it is possible to leverage state-of-the-art robotic techniques to improve how an RL agent learns. We hope that our environment will allow more (future) RL algorithms to be evaluated on commercial robotic tasks.

RaspberryPi-cam is used to capture picture of the faces that are to be stored in the database in the form of grayscale and colored image. This is a three-stage process namely, face detection, data gathering, and face recognition, which will match the live faces with facial pictures stored in the database and give us identification details of the person under consideration. If the matching index is 45% or more then only the face will be recognized properly. Here, Haar-Cascade algorithm is used and this whole setup is successfully demonstrated using a RaspberryPi model 3B hardware setup. Based on successful face recognition, a miniature door will open and the security of the system will be ensured.

This model complements extended finite-state machines with some basic state stack operations that enable not only dealing with hierarchy but also with planning, which is a key element for belief-desire-intention (BDI) agents. Special care was taken to make the representation of these extended finite-state stack machines (EFS2M) simple so that their programming is straightforward. Through an educational example we show how such class of models are, and the potentiality of the solution.

The quality of optical components such as lenses or mirrors can be described by shape errors and surface roughness. Whilst the trend towards sub nanometre level surfaces finishes and features progresses, matching both form and finish coherently in complex parts remains a major challenge. With increasing optic sizes, the stability of the polishing process becomes more and more important. If not empirically known, the optical surface must be measured after each polishing step. One approach is to mount sensors on the polishing head in order to measure process-relevant quantities. On the basis of these data, machine learning algorithms can be applied for surface value prediction. Due to the modification of the polishing head by the installation of sensors and the resulting process influences, the first machine learning model could only make removal predictions with insufficient accuracy. The aim of this work is to show a polishing head optimised for the sensors, which is coupled with a machine learning model in order to predict the material removal and failure of the polishing head during robot polishing. The artificial neural network is developed in the Python programming language using the Keras deep learning library. It starts with a simple network architecture and common training parameters. The model will then be optimised step-by-step using different methods and optimised in different steps. The data collected by a design of experiments with the sensor-integrated glass polishing head are used to train the machine learning model and to validate the results. The neural network achieves a prediction accuracy of the material removal of 99.22%. Article highlights: First machine learning model application for robot polishing of optical glass ceramicsThe polishing process is influenced by a large number of different process parameters. Machine learning can be used to adjust any process parameter and predict the change in material removal with a certain probability.

However, a major limitation is that in practical applications, robots usually face dynamic obstacles such as pedestrian crowds. These dynamic objects create significant challenges for both collision-free navigation and accurate localization/mapping, which can compromise the safety and exploration performance of the robot. In this work, a hierarchical approach is proposed for both effective exploration and collision-free navigation in crowded environments. The central idea of our approach is to combine local and global information to ensure the safety and efficiency of the exploration planner. Besides, our planning method utilizes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based obstacle avoidance algorithm that allows the robot to safely follow the exploration planner's path through the pedestrian crowd. The proposed system is thoroughly evaluated in simulation environments, and the results show that it outperforms existing methods in terms of not only the exploration efficiency but also the localization and mapping accuracy.",collision avoidance | Motion and path planning,4,0,,,GRF,11202119,Glaucoma Research Foundation

A significant source of difficulty in this determination arises from stochasticity and uncertainty, coming from localization error, sensor sparsity and noise, difficult-to-model robot-ground interactions, and disturbances to the motion of the vehicle. Classical approaches to this problem rely on geometric analysis of the surrounding terrain, which can be prone to modeling errors and can be computationally expensive. Moreover, modeling the distribution of uncertain traversability costs is a difficult task, compounded by the various error sources mentioned above. In this work, we take a principled learning approach to this problem. We introduce a neural network architecture for robustly learning the distribution of traversability costs. Because we are motivated by preserving the life of the robot, we tackle this learning problem from the perspective of learning tail-risks, i.e. the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). We show that this approach reliably learns the expected tail risk given a desired probability risk threshold between 0 and 1, producing a traversability costmap which is more robust to outliers, more accurately captures tail risks, and is more computationally efficient, when compared against baselines. We validate our method on data collected by a legged robot navigating challenging, unstructured environments including an abandoned subway, limestone caves, and lava tube caves.",deep learning methods | field robots | motion and path planning | Planning under uncertainty | robotics in hazardous fields,7,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The publication of Oswald Spengler’s “The Decline of the West” in 1918 was a cultural event of European scale. Research interest in Spengler’s book, which marks the point of reference of cultural and historical processes in the 20th century, continues unabated in the 21st century. The centennial of the first volume publication was marked by scientific events, a series of academic and educational publications that offer a new context for understanding the philosopher’s ideas. German researchers attribute the “Spengler effect” to the actualization of the cultural identity of Europe as a single communication space. The Russian reception of Spengler’s work allows us to actualize his ideas at a time of cultural ruptures and to comprehend the existence of a common cultural tradition. In contrast to Spengler’s hopelessly eschatological insights and the rationalistically determined, ideologized commentaries of German interpreters, the Russian tradition of understanding the philosopher’s cultural heritage has a personal sense of empathy and denies fatal predetermination. Russian scholars are critical of Spengler’s methodology, recognizing the symbolic significance of his mythological thinking. Considering “The Decline of the West” among the most important texts of the 20th century, which defined the development of European spiritual culture, domestic Thinkers and writers highlight the artistic value and original style of the treatise. The symptoms of Western culture weakening enumerated by O. Spengler in the early 20th century are manifested in the negative megatrends of our time. European culture and public identity of the 21st century are experiencing a systemic crisis. The cultural identity of modernity fixes spiritual losses, the loss of the semantic foundations of existence. Recent value orientations and creative practices confirm the productivity of the German philosopher’s predictions about the tragically preordained fate of the West. Spengler’s ideas correlate with the insights of European artists painfully experiencing a traumatic historical experience. The work of well-known German writers Peter Handke and Roland Schimmelpfennig embodies the destructive processes of modern society: the manias and phobias of the inhabitants of the “world city”, the formalization and cliched language, the devaluation of the value system. Spengler’s characterization of the “world city” is relevant to contemporary culture that formats the artistic space of virtual reality.

Most of these methods represent the environments as fixed size images and take these as inputs to neural networks. However, the size of environments is usually unknown, which makes these methods fail to generalize to real world scenarios. To address this issue, we present a novel state representation method based on 4D point-clouds-like information, including the locations, frontier, and distance information. We also design a neural network that can process these 4D point-clouds-like information and generate the estimated value for each frontier. Then this neural network is trained using the typical reinforcement learning framework. We test the performance of our proposed method by comparing it with other five methods and test its scalability on maps that are much larger than maps in the training set.

This problem is probed with the sim-to-real (sim2real) deep reinforcement learning, such that a moving policy of the robotic arm is learnt in a simulator and then adapted to the real world. However, the problem of sim2real adaptation is notoriously difficult. To this end, this work proposes (1) a unified representation of obstacles and targets to capture the underlying dynamics of the environment while allowing generalization to unseen goals and (2) a flexible end-to-end model combining the unified representation with the deep reinforcement learning control module that can be trained by interacting with the environment. Such a representation is agnostic to the shape and appearance of the underlying objects, which simplifies and unifies the scene representation in both simulated and real worlds. We implement this idea with a vision-based actor-critic framework by devising a bounding box predictor module. The predictor estimates the 3D bounding boxes of obstacles and targets from the RGB-D input. The features extracted by the predictor are fed into the policy network, and all the modules are jointly trained. This makes the policy learn object-aware scene representation, which leads to a data-efficient learning of the obstacle avoidance policy. Our experiments in simulated environment and the real-world show that the end-to-end model of the unified representation achieves better sim2real adaption and scene generalization than state-of-the-art techniques.","collision avoidance | Planning under uncertainty | reinforcement learning | robotic manipulator, unified representation",13,0,,,,undefined,

It will fill the gap between hi-tech technology and the old traditional way of doing agriculture. This paper outlines a study of different iOS mobile machine learning and artificial framework and libraries which can be used in plant disease detection in agriculture. This paper also discusses the efficient use of these libraries in the iOS mobile app for better results. Many iOS ML and AI libraries have been studied which can be used directly in the iOS app with offline support, which means without interacting with the server and python language. The main criteria for selecting these libraries are mainly using the libraries directly in the iOS app using either Swift or Objective-C programming language. This will remove the dependency on server-side implementation and the needs of the python programming language. This study is used in designing the architecture of the iOS app for plant leaf disease detection and cotton plant disease classification.",Apple | Artificial intelligence | Classification | Cotton leaf | CreateML | Disease detection | iOS | Machine learning | Offline iOS app | Swift for TensorFlow | Tensor flow,1,0,,,,undefined,

However, current systems suffer from several shortcomings including time-consuming, 3D registration and segmentation accuracies as well as difficulties transferring 3D vessel imaging to the neuronavigation systems. In this work, we introduce a standalone platform for image-fusion, and semantic segmentation of MR angiography images supported for neurovascular interventions. The full-stack toolkit consists of two parts: back-end and front-end. At back-end, Tensorflow library and Ajax for application programming interface server request-response interactions are embedded. As to front-end, we implement C++_based Qt platform for GUI (Graphic User Interface) in Visual Studio integrated development environment. The toolkit provides 3D volume and slice-based visualizations of brain multimodal images. All medical images are archived in DICOM standard, then converted into NIfTI formats. Visualization Toolkit was used to render 3D MR images. The implemented volume-rendering techniques allow the direct visualization of vascular structures, thus reveal vessel abnormalities more faithfully. We provide GUI interface of the modality brain image registration and segmentation functionality. There are two machine-learning based automatic registration categories: (1) intensity-based, (2) geometry-based. The registration error in mm is computed by using Hausdorff Distance metric. As for cerebrovascular segmentation, a method that utilizes an enhanced vesselness filter which bases on multiscale Hessian eigenvalues is performed to extract neurovascular trees. The introduced toolkit is expected to be a validated platform that allows researchers to apply insightful results into the operating room for clinical evaluations.",Brain vessel segmentation | Deep learning | Multimodality registration | Neuronavigation system | Neurovascular,0,0,,,GIST,DS188,Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology

They are recognized as an effective means of studying complex and abstract systems. In traditional teaching of compiler concepts, students are incapable of visualizing theoretical constructions, while the use of simulation systems represents an excellent blend of theoretical and practical experience. This paper describes a software system for visualization and simulation of basic compiler concepts and algorithms. The simulation tool enables students to visualize the operation of finite automata, convert a regular expression into deterministic finite automata (DFA) or nondeterministic finite automata, and simulate Thompson's construction algorithm. The process of constructing the LL(0) and LR(1) parsing tables is represented as a step-by-step simulation, with the user receives feedback on the correctness of each step before moving on to the next. The system is capable of calculating the FIRST and FOLLOW sets, graphically representing DFA, and constructing the corresponding parsing table.

Collaboration is commonly integrated into CT education to facilitate novice learning, but there is inadequate knowledge regarding the influences of collaboration in CT education. This meta-analysis examined the overall effects on the cognitive, social and affective competencies of collaborative versus individual problem solving in CT through programming. We identified 33 publications involving 4717 learners, which allowed for 220 effect size comparisons. We found a medium effect size (Hedges' g = 0.562; p < 0.001) in favour of collaborative problem solving on cognitive learning outcomes and a small effect size (Hedges' g = 0.316; p < 0.01) on affective learning outcomes using a random-effects model. Categorical moderator analysis revealed the moderating effects of educational level, programming environment, study duration, grouping method and group size. The competency model that was generated from the synthesized literature on collaborative computational problem solving yielded insights into the learning design and assessment of relevant activities. Practitioner notes What is already known about the topic? Although professional programming usually requires collaboration to accomplish common goals in the work environment, programming is predominantly taught on an individual basis in educational settings. Some intervention studies have reported inconsistent learning outcomes (positive and negative) from integrating collaborative problem solving (CPS) into programming education. There is a need for further scrutiny and exploration of the role of collaboration in the process of learning to program. What does this paper add? Our meta-analysis showed that CPS is an effective pedagogical tool for developing students' cognitive, affective and social competencies. The moderator analysis revealed that CPS in programming has cognitive benefits irrespective of grouping method, group size and educational levels; however, there is a need for caution in regard to designing collaborative problem-solving activities for different programming environments and durations. The model generated from the literature synthesis can yield insights into better assessing and designing collaborative problem-solving activities. Implications for practice and/or policy? Integrating CPS into programming education can prepare students with 21st century skills. Social and affective competencies are crucial to students' learning capacity, which is an issue that needs to be better assessed. Future studies could look more rigorously into the effects of CPS in visual programming and robotics programming among younger age groups, such as primary or middle school students.",,14,0,,,研究資助局,18615216,"Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee"

A learning optimization (LO) framework is established. Multiple criteria are defined to evaluate the performance quantitatively, and implementations with different sub-methods are discussed. In particular, a database generation method based on input space mapping is proposed for generating valid and representative samples. The methods presented are applied on a practical application—haptic interaction in virtual reality systems. The results show that the input space mapping method significantly elevates the efficiency and quality of database generation and consequently improves the performance of the LO. With the LO method, real-time trajectory generation with high dimensional inputs is achieved, which lays the foundation for robots with high dimensional DOFs to execute complex tasks in dynamic environments.",global optimization | human–robot interaction | machine learning | Real-time trajectory planning | serial manipulators,1,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In fact, teaching robots new actions from scratch that can be reused for previously unseen tasks remains a difficult challenge and is generally left up to robotics experts. In this work, we present iRoPro, an interactive Robot Programming framework that allows end-users with little to no technical background to teach a robot new reusable actions. We combine Programming by Demonstration and Automated Planning techniques to allow the user to construct the robot’s knowledge base by teaching new actions by kinesthetic demonstration. The actions are generalised and reused with a task planner to solve previously unseen problems defined by the user. We implement iRoPro as an end-to-end system on a Baxter Research Robot to simultaneously teach low- and high-level actions by demonstration that the user can customise via a Graphical User Interface to adapt to their specific use case. To evaluate the feasibility of our approach, we first conducted pre-design experiments to better understand the user’s adoption of involved concepts and the proposed robot programming process. We compare results with post-design experiments, where we conducted a user study to validate the usability of our approach with real end-users. Overall, we showed that users with different programming levels and educational backgrounds can easily learn and use iRoPro and its robot programming process.",Automated planning | End-User robot programming | Human-Robot interaction | Programming by demonstration,3,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,
