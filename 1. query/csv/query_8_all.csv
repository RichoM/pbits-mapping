10.1145/3561391,The Perception of Teachers on Usability and Accessibility of Programming Materials for Children with Visual Impairments,"Programming education is strongly emerging in elementary and high school. Diversity and inclusion are important topics, however, insights on suited programming materials for younger learners with visual impairments are lacking. A wide range of programming materials for children exists, diverse in both what is being programmed (output) and how this is done (input), yet often relying on visual features. An understanding of the usability and accessibility aspects of these different materials is important to inform educational practice and to increase understanding of what makes programming materials suited for low vision and blind children. The aim of this study is to explore the usability and accessibility of programming materials currently used in education to low vision and blind children in the Netherlands. A focus group was conducted with six teachers or IT experts, all working with the target group in special education. The thematic analysis of the discussion of 25 materials (including unplugged lessons, robots and robotic kits, block-based and text-based languages) showed the potential of several materials, especially unplugged lessons, and the continuing search for suited materials and workforms specifically for the blind children. Furthermore, prioritizing ""fun""and close connections to children's daily life as well as careful explorations of usability at the cognitive level came forward as important factors for future research and development in programming materials for low vision and blind children. These insights can contribute to obtaining an inclusive approach to programming for young learners.",ar,2022-12-29,ACM Transactions on Computing Education,Children's programming materials | usability and accessibility | visual impairments,2-s2.0-85148000425,,,Article,Van Der Meulen A.,60108010;60019816;60008734;129182145,Saxion University of Applied Sciences;Universiteit Leiden;Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam;Royal Dutch Vision,Deventer;Leiden;Amsterdam;Huizen,Netherlands;Netherlands;Netherlands;Netherlands,4,"Van Der Meulen, Anna;Hartendorp, Mijke;Voorn, Wendy;Hermans, Felienne",57222814221;36547979900;58102758800;35573133300,60019816;60108010;129182145;60019816-60008734,29 December 2022,,19700183047,19466226,Journal,23,1,14,,0,,undefined,,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3561391
10.1145/3556539,Training PPA Models for Embedded Memories on a Low-data Diet,"Supervised machine learning requires large amounts of labeled data for training. In power, performance, and area (PPA) estimation of embedded memories, every new memory compiler version is considered independently of previous compiler versions. Since the data of different memory compilers originate from similar domains, transfer learning may reduce the amount of supervised data required by pre-training PPA estimation neural networks on related domains. We show that provisioning times of PPA models for new compiler versions can be reduced significantly by exploiting similarities among different compilers, versions, and technology nodes. Through transfer learning, we shorten the time to provision PPA models for new compiler versions, which speeds up time-critical periods of the design cycle. Using only 901 training samples (10%) is sufficient to achieve an almost worst-case (98th percentile) estimation error of 2.67% and allows us to shorten model provisioning times from 40 days to less than one week without sacrificing accuracy. To enable a diverse set of source domains for transfer learning, we devise a new, application-independent method for overcoming structural domain differences through domain equalization that attains competitive results when compared to domain-free transfer. A high degree of automation necessitates the efficient assessment of the best source domains. We propose using various metrics to accurately identify four of the five best among 45 datasets with low computational effort.",ar,2022-12-24,ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems,artificial neural networks | deep learning | Electronic design automation | few-shot learning | machine learning | memory compilers | regression | transfer learning,2-s2.0-85152480935,,,Article,Last F.,60104055;60019722,Intel Deutschland GmbH;Technische Universität München,Munich;Munich,Germany;Germany,2,"Last, Felix;Schlichtmann, Ulf",57202820057;6603456416,60019722-60104055;60019722,24 December 2022,10844309,18662,15577309,Journal,28,2,3556539,,0,,undefined,,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3556539
10.3389/fncom.2022.1039822,Adapting hippocampus multi-scale place field distributions in cluttered environments optimizes spatial navigation and learning,"Extensive studies in rodents show that place cells in the hippocampus have firing patterns that are highly correlated with the animal's location in the environment and are organized in layers of increasing field sizes or scales along its dorsoventral axis. In this study, we use a spatial cognition model to show that different field sizes could be exploited to adapt the place cell representation to different environments according to their size and complexity. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis of how to distribute place cell fields according to the obstacles in cluttered environments to optimize learning time and path optimality during goal-oriented spatial navigation tasks. The analysis uses a reinforcement learning (RL) model that assumes that place cells allow encoding the state. While previous studies have suggested exploiting different field sizes to represent areas requiring different spatial resolutions, our work analyzes specific distributions that adapt the representation to the environment, activating larger fields in open areas and smaller fields near goals and subgoals (e.g., obstacle corners). In addition to assessing how the multi-scale representation may be exploited in spatial navigation tasks, our analysis and results suggest place cell representations that can impact the robotics field by reducing the total number of cells for path planning without compromising the quality of the paths learned.",ar,2022-12-12,Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience,hippocampus | multi-scale | place cells | reinforcement learning | spatial cognition | spatial learning | spatial navigation,2-s2.0-85144825485,,,Article,Scleidorovich P.,60010065;60007740,"The University of Arizona;University of South Florida, Tampa",Tucson;Tampa,United States;United States,3,"Scleidorovich, Pablo;Fellous, Jean Marc;Weitzenfeld, Alfredo",57211276928;7003806123;15836291700,60007740;60010065;60007740,12 December 2022,,19700175168,16625188,Journal,16,,1039822,,1,,1703225,,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2022.1039822
10.1093/jcde/qwac109,A novel bio-inspired approach with multi-resolution mapping for the path planning of multi-robot system in complex environments,"For multi-robot systems (MRSs), conventional path planning with single resolution mapping is challenging to balance information and computation. Regarding path planning of MRS, the previous research lacked systematic definition, quantitative evaluation, and the consideration of complex environmental factors. In this paper, a new systematic formulation is proposed to redefine the multi-robot path planning problem in complex environments, and evaluate the related solutions of this problem. To solve this problem, a novel bio-inspired approach based on reaction-diffusion system is given to deal with the path planning of MRS in complex environments, such as electromagnetic interference, ocean currents, and so on. Furthermore, a multi-layer neural dynamic network is proposed to describe environments with multiple resolutions, which can improve time performance while ensuring the integrity of environmental information. Comparative experimental results indicate that the proposed approach shows the excellent path planning performance of MRS in complex environments. The stability of the proposed method is determined by the mathematical basis.",ar,2022-12-01,Journal of Computational Design and Engineering,multi-robot system | neural dynamics | obstacle avoidance | path planning,2-s2.0-85160023902,,,Article,Yi X.,60015881;60000937,University of Guelph;Shenzhen University,Guelph;Shenzhen,Canada;China,4,"Yi, Xin;Zhu, Anmin;Li, Chaofan;Yang, Simon X.",57202211930;7102514589;57897840900;57281389600,60000937;60000937;60000937;60015881,1 December 2022,22884300,21100820602,22885048,Journal,9,6,,2343-2354,1,,undefined,,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.1093/jcde/qwac109
10.1134/S1064562422060229,Planning and Learning in Multi-Agent Path Finding,"Abstract: Multi-agent path finding arises, on the one hand, in numerous applied areas. A classical example is automated warehouses with a large number of mobile goods-sorting robots operating simultaneously. On the other hand, for this problem, there are no universal solution methods that simultaneously satisfy numerous (often contradictory) requirements. Examples of such criteria are a guarantee of finding optimal solutions, high-speed operation, the possibility of operation in partially observable environments, etc. This paper provides a survey of modern methods for multi-agent path finding. Special attention is given to various settings of the problem. The differences and between learnable and nonlearnable solution methods and their applicability are discussed. Experimental programming environments necessary for implementing learnable approaches are analyzed separately.",ar,2022-12-01,Doklady Mathematics,heuristic search | multi-agent systems | path planning | reinforcement learning,2-s2.0-85146812973,,,Article,Yakovlev K.S.,60110807;100601257,Federal Research Center Informatics and Management of the Russian Academy of Sciences;Artificial Intelligence Research Institute,Moscow;Moscow,Russian Federation;Russian Federation,4,"Yakovlev, K.

10.3390/su142416514,Learning Performance of Different Genders’ Computational Thinking,"While the role of computational thinking (CT) has been widely reported in technology applications and further integrated into interdisciplinary learning, the integration of pedagogy-supported interdisciplinary activities for the empowerment of girls’ learning must not solely emphasise CT problem-solving skills. Rather, it must scaffold them with interactive learning that supports their characteristics while catering to gender equality. In this study, a gender-balanced interdisciplinary activity, integrating CT with Mandarin learning (ML), was designed for an elementary school in the Mandarin as a Second Language learning context using Social Robots (SRs). It sought to verify the results of the proposed method along with focused activities and interaction in an SR-integrated activity on the CT abilities and target-language learning of young learners. A total of 46 Grade 5 students, 26 boys and 20 girls, participated in the experiment. The study used a quasi-experimental method by examining the result of pre- and post-tests on language acquisition, programming self-efficacy, the educational robot attitude, and learning perceptions in the activity. The results indicated that there were no gender differences in terms of ML, self-efficacy in programming, or attitudes toward using SRs in the SR-integrated interdisciplinary activities. However, the boys and girls had different perceptions of learning. Suggestions for conducting SR-integrated interdisciplinary learning are given, along with pedagogical implications for the further promotion of women in technology.",ar,2022-12-01,Sustainability (Switzerland),computational thinking | educational robots | game-based learning | gender difference | interdisciplinary activities,2-s2.0-85144874518,,,Article,Hsu T.C.,60022637;60010940,National Taiwan Normal University;National Institute of Education,Taipei;Singapore City,Taiwan;Singapore,4,"Hsu, Ting Chia;Chang, Ching;Wong, Lung Hsiang;Aw, Guat Poh",35173046500;57212663683;35212726900;56071782500,60022637;60022637;60010940;60010940,December 2022,,21100240100,20711050,Journal,14,24,16514,,1,MOST,108-2511-H-003-056-MY3,Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/su142416514
10.3390/s22249574,Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient-Based Autonomous Driving for Mobile Robots in Sparse Reward Environments,"In this paper, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based path-planning method for mobile robots by applying the hindsight experience replay (HER) technique to overcome the performance degradation resulting from sparse reward problems occurring in autonomous driving mobile robots. The mobile robot in our analysis was a robot operating system-based TurtleBot3, and the experimental environment was a virtual simulation based on Gazebo. A fully connected neural network was used as the DDPG network based on the actor–critic architecture. Noise was added to the actor network. The robot recognized an unknown environment by measuring distances using a laser sensor and determined the optimized policy to reach its destination. The HER technique improved the learning performance by generating three new episodes with normal experience from a failed episode. The proposed method demonstrated that the HER technique could help mitigate the sparse reward problem; this was further corroborated by the successful autonomous driving results obtained after applying the proposed method to two reward systems, as well as actual experimental results.",ar,2022-12-01,Sensors,autonomous driving | deep deterministic policy gradient | hindsight experience replay | mobile robot | reinforcement learning | sparse reward environments,2-s2.0-85144557389,,36559941,Article,Park M.,60025615;60001170,Soonchunhyang University;Yeungnam University,Asan;Gyeongsan,South Korea;South Korea,4,"Park, Minjae;Lee, Seok Young;Hong, Jin Seok;Kwon, Nam Kyu",57961064800;55919523400;57961278000;55902868000,60001170;60025615;60001170;60001170,December 2022,14248220,130124,,Journal,22,24,9574,,1,YU,2020R1F1A1064330,Yeungnam University,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22249574
10.3390/su142315951,Employing Robotics in Education to Enhance Cognitive Development—A Pilot Study,"(1) Background: Info-communication technology (ICT) offers opportunities for innovations in teaching and learning methods, bringing significant changes in the world of pedagogy. The field called educational robotics is both a motivational basis for teaching and learning coding and programming, and a tool for linking STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. Moreover, it might contribute to the development of cognitive and social skills. The aim of the present paper is to report on a pilot study at the intersection of neurodiversity and educational robotics. (2) Methods: The pilot study was part of a larger project, namely Robotics for the Inclusive Development of Atypical and Typical Children (RIDE). A pre-test/post-test design was used to examine the development of different cognitive processes in sixth-grade students, such as computational thinking (CT), spatial relations, visuo-constructive ability, attention, and reading ability, in relation to a robotics development program employed in the classroom. (3) Results: The results suggest a general improvement on nearly all measures. Specifically, participants’ performance improved significantly from pre-test to post-test in the visuo-constructive abilities test, they made significantly fewer reading errors, and improved substantially in their reading comprehension.

10.1007/s10836-022-06037-4,Development of a Simplified Programming Kit Based 16LF18856 for Embedded Systems Testing and Education in Developing Countries,"Embedded systems and applications have recently emerged as a domain of high interest to the general public in developing countries. Unfortunately, these countries lack the technological infrastructure for the design, testing, and implementation of projects in the domain. This paper presents a Very Simple Programming Kit (VSPK) for Embedded Systems suitable for practical training, project design, and testing in the domain for use in developing countries. The microcontroller-based system makes it easy to test, teach and train in various areas of embedded systems including programming, communication, signal acquisition and processing, remote control, and domotics. A VSPK prototype has been produced and is used for real-time simulation of Embedded applications. This operation involves the VSPK, the PIC programmer, the PC and the application program to be tested progressively and the displays observed on the LCD and LEDs. The debugging process is easily performed and errors are detected and corrected. The main features of VSPK are low production cost, low power consumption, flexible peripheral pin selection, integrated LCD module, and simple hardware and software environment. Unlike similar kits available for educational purposes, VSPK possesses some advantages such as an integrated graphic color LCD, a configurable internal oscillator, numerically controlled oscillators, testing LEDs, testing buttons, and complete access to multiple programming languages. Two experimental and simple tests for validation of VSPK have been carried out, and the results show that VSPK performs satisfactorily.",ar,2022-12-01,Journal of Electronic Testing: Theory and Applications (JETTA),Education | Embedded systems | Microcontroller programming | Sub-Saharan Africa | Testing,2-s2.0-85143291722,,,Article,Nguimfack-Ndongmo J.d.D.,60116807;60070928;60070927;60070926;128941311,University of Bamenda;Université de Yaoundé I;University of Douala;University of Buea;Université de Dschang,Bamenda;Yaounde;Douala;Buea;Bandjoun,Cameroon;Cameroon;Cameroon;Cameroon;Cameroon,6,"Nguimfack-Ndongmo, Jean de Dieu;Kentsa Zana, Kevin;Asoh, Derek Ajesam;Kengnou Telem, Nicole Adélaïde;Kuate-Fochie, René;Kenné, Godpromesse",55863679000;57992199100;8660791400;57992264400;55863764400;12766614000,60116807-128941311;60070927;60116807-60070928;60070926;128941311;128941311,December 2022,09238174,18040,15730727,Journal,38,6,,589-602,0,,undefined,,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10836-022-06037-4
10.1016/j.mechatronics.2022.102918,Robot path planner based on deep reinforcement learning and the seeker optimization algorithm,"Path planning is one of the key technologies for mobile robot applications. However, the traditional robot path planner has a slow planning response, which leads to a long navigation completion time. In this paper, we propose a novel robot path planner (SOA+A2C) that produces global and local path planners with the seeker optimization algorithm (SOA) and the advantage actor-critic (A2C) algorithm, respectively. In addition, to solve the problems of poor convergence performance when training deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in complex path planning tasks and path redundancy when metaheuristic algorithms, such as SOA, are used for path planning, we propose the incremental map training method and path de-redundancy method. Simulation results show that first, the incremental map training method can improve the convergence performance of the DRL agent in complex path planning tasks. Second, the path de-redundancy method can effectively alleviate path redundancy without sacrificing the search capability of the metaheuristic algorithm. Third, the SOA+A2C path planner is superior to the Dijkstra & dynamic window approach (Dijkstra+DWA) and the Dijkstra & timed elastic band (Dijkstra+TEB) path planners provided by the robot operating system (ROS) in terms of path length, path planning response time, and navigation completion time. Therefore, the developed SOA+A2C path planner can serve as an effective tool for mobile robot path planning.",ar,2022-12-01,Mechatronics,Advantage actor-critic | Deep reinforcement learning | Path de-redundancy | Path planning | Seeker optimization algorithm,2-s2.0-85141780201,S0957415822001362,,Article,Xing X.,60028009;127058978,Yunnan University;Yunnan Education Department,Kunming;Kunming,China;China,5,"Xing, Xiangrui;Ding, Hongwei;Liang, Zhuguan;Li, Bo;Yang, Zhijun",57204050727;35995295900;56250017800;57195397849;57188805913,60028009;60028009;60028009;60028009;60028009-127058978,December 2022,09574158,21096,,Journal,88,,102918,,0,NSFC,"2,020,306",National Natural Science Foundation of China,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mechatronics.2022.102918
10.1177/00219983221134929,Si-based self-programming neuromorphic integrated circuits for intelligent morphing wings,"Unlike artificial intelligent systems based on computers, which must be programmed for specific tasks, the human brain can learn in real-time to create new tactics and adapt to complex, unpredictable environments. Computers embedded in artificial intelligent systems can execute arbitrary inference algorithms capable of outperforming humans at specific tasks. However, without real-time self-programming functionality, they must be preprogrammed by humans and will likely to fail in unpredictable environments beyond their preprogrammed domains. In this work, a Si-based synaptic resistor (synstor) was developed by integrating Al2Ox/TaOy materials to emulate biological synapses. The synstors were characterized, and their operation mechanism based on the charge stored in the oxygen vacancies in the Al2Ox material was simulated and analyzed, to understand the inference, learning, and memory functions of the synstors. A self-programming neuromorphic integrated circuit (SNIC) based on synstors was fabricated to execute inference and learning algorithms concurrently in real-time with an energy efficiency more than six-orders of magnitudes higher than those of standard digital computers. The SNIC dynamically modified its algorithm in a real-time learning process to control a morphing wing, thus successfully improving its lift-to-drag force ratio and recovering the wing from stall in complex aerodynamic environments. The synaptic resistor circuits can potentially circumvent the fundamental limitations of computers, thus providing a platform analogous to neurobiological network with real-time self-programming functionality for artificial intelligent systems.",ar,2022-12-01,Journal of Composite Materials,intelligent morphing wing | self-programming neuromorphic integrated circuits | Si-based synaptic resistor,2-s2.0-85140579165,,,Article,Nathan D.,60117623;60025778;60020547;60012708;60007278,"California NanoSystems Institute;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Texas A&amp;M University;Stanford University;University of California, Irvine",Los Angeles;Ann Arbor;College Station;Palo Alto;Irvine,United States;United States;United States;United States;United States,21,"Nathan, Dhruva;Deo, Atharva;Haughn, Kevin;Yi, Suin;Lee, Jungmin;Gao, Dawei;Shenoy, Rahul;Xu, Mingjie;Tran, Ich C.;Zheng, Jian Guo;Rong, Zixuan;Wang, Mingyu;Shaffer, Christopher M.;Wu, Chen;Topac, Tanay;Chen, Xiyuan;He, Lei;Chang, Fu Kuo;Williams, R.

10.1109/TC.2022.3213177,ReAAP: A Reconfigurable and Algorithm-Oriented Array Processor With Compiler-Architecture Co-Design,"Parallelism and data reuse are the most critical issues for the design of hardware acceleration in a deep learning processor. Besides, abundant on-chip memories and precise data management are intrinsic design requirements because most of deep learning algorithms are data-driven and memory-bound. In this paper, we propose a compiler-architecture co-design scheme targeting a reconfigurable and algorithm-oriented array processor, named ReAAP. Given specific deep neural networks, the proposed co-design scheme is effective to perform parallelism and data reuse optimization on compute-intensive layers for guiding reconfigurable computing in hardware. Especially, the systemic optimization is performed in our proposed domain-specific compiler to deal with the intrinsic tensions between parallelism and data locality, for the purpose of automatically mapping diverse layer-level workloads onto our proposed reconfigurable array architecture. In this architecture, abundant on-chip memories are software-controlled and its massive data access is precisely handled by compiler-generated instructions.

10.1016/j.cola.2022.101156,Block-based abstractions and expansive services to make advanced computing concepts accessible to novices,"Many block-based programming environments have proven to be effective at engaging novices in learning programming. However, most offer only restricted access to the outside world, limiting learners to commands and computing resources built in to the environment. Some allow learners to drag and drop files, connect to sensors and robots locally or issue HTTP requests. But in a world where most of the applications in our daily lives are distributed (i.e., their functionality depends on communicating with other computers or accessing resources and data on the internet), the limited support for beginners to envision and create such distributed programs is a lost opportunity. We argue that it is feasible to create environments with simple yet powerful abstractions that open up distributed computing and other widely-used but advanced computing concepts including networking, the Internet of Things, and cybersecurity to novices. The paper presents the architecture of and design decisions behind NetsBlox, a programming environment that supports these ideas. We show how NetsBlox expands opportunities for learning considerably: NetsBlox projects can access a wealth of online data and web services, and they can communicate with other projects. Moreover, the tool infrastructure enables young learners to collaborate with each other during program construction, whether they share their physical location or study remotely. Importantly, providing access to the wider world will also help counter widespread student perceptions that block-based environments are mere toys, and show that they are capable of creating compelling applications. In this way, NetsBlox offers an illuminating example of how tools can be designed to democratize access to powerful ideas in computing.",ar,2022-12-01,Journal of Computer Languages,Block based programming | Distributed computing | Message passing | NetsBlox | Remote procedure calls,2-s2.0-85139062058,S2590118422000533,,Article,Brady C.,60004923;60003915;121802734,NC State University;Vanderbilt University;Looking Glass Ventures,Raleigh;Nashville;Palo Alto,United States;United States;United States,8,"Brady, Corey;Broll, Brian;Stein, Gordon;Jean, Devin;Grover, Shuchi;Cateté, Veronica;Barnes, Tiffany;Lédeczi, Ákos",56247212200;56426529000;53985437300;57223929783;55606048500;55315415400;57203256045;6603835209,60003915;60003915;60003915;60003915;121802734;60004923;60004923;60003915,December 2022,,21100904890,25901184,Journal,73,,101156,,0,NSF,1835874,National Science Foundation,2,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cola.2022.101156

AOT of FFSM systems has two main difficulties: modeling and control of FFSM systems and tracking motion planning of space manipulators. To deal with these problems, the paper proposed an active object tracking proposal of FFSM systems using deep reinforcement learning(DRL) algorithm, Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO). Our approach is completely data-driven, which avoids the complex modeling process of FFSM and does not require motion planning for space manipulators, which is more concise than traditional algorithms. We trained and tested the algorithm by building a simulation environment in CoppeliaSim, and compared with the resolved motion rate control(RMRC).

The GAN-based architecture presents an efficient and accurate path to plan the footsteps of a humanoid robot on Robot Operating System (ROS) based architecture. During navigation, humanoid robots must understand their surroundings and be able to generate footsteps accurately. Although some algorithms that are based on sampling, such as Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT*) and A*, are widely used for path planning, they fail to perform in narrow paths, especially for the footstep generation of humanoid robots. The widely growing deep learning approaches such as GANs are now producing extremely surprising results in solving real-life problems. The experiments conclude that GAN based approach performs better than conventional Dijkstra's or A* algorithms.

The current study emphasized the shortfalls of the previous investigation on multi-robot path planning and offered an energetic methodology through the hybridization of modified Q-learning with the improved version of particle swarm optimization (IPSO) and arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA). In the current scenario, classical Q-learning is modified through a reward policy and generates the best solution for PSO. The basic PSO is upgraded through the perception of ascendency in human civilization and generates an optimal location in the succeeding iteration using an arithmetic optimization algorithm. The proposed hybrid algorithm primarily highlights evaluating the optimal deadlock and starvation free subsequent positions of every robot from their current position, optimizing the path distance for every robot. The authentication of the projected hybrid procedure has been confirmed through benchmark function, computer real robot through webbots simulator, and simulation.

However, it is a challenging task to implement a feasible embedded detection model with advanced machine learning techniques such as deep learning. It is due to the limited support provided by programming languages on the data plane and the computing resource constraints at the edge. We propose a joint traffic classification architecture called JointNIDS that splits a classification model into two sequential sub-models. In this model, the primary switch is dedicated to major attack classification. The secondary switch is used mainly for a further in-depth inspection of the rest of the minor traffic types. The presence of some partially overlapping hidden units in the two sequential switches can help to reduce the computational overhead at the edge, while increasing the packet inspection throughput. Experimental results on the P4 framework demonstrate that JointNIDS has reduced attack detection time, while achieving a similar accuracy performance, as other counterpart algorithms. To further develop the proposed architecture, JointNIDS implements an optimization step. It maximizes the amount of data to be inspected by a system, taking into account the constraints of computing resources and network bandwidth for a given performance requirement.

10.1109/THMS.2022.3194593,A Variational Bayesian Gaussian Mixture-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Model to Extract Movement Primitives for Robust Control,"Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a powerful tool for parameter estimation applied in numerous robotics applications, such as path planning, motion trajectory prediction, and motion intention detection. In particular, NMF has been successfully used to extract simplified and organized movement primitives from myoelectric signal (MES) for robust control of multi-degree of freedom humanoid robots. However, MES is typically contaminated by complex noise sources. The system performance often degrades due to the simplified Gaussian assumption of the noise distribution in existing NMF methods. Furthermore, most existing NMF models are unable to automatically determine the rank of the latent matrices. To address these issues, this article presents a hybrid variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture and NMF (GMNMF) model with a finite Gaussian mixture model adopted to fit the mixed noise density function of MES. In addition, the automatic relevant determination criterion is applied to automatically infer the number of movement primitives. The coordinate descent update rules for the proposed model are formulated by mean-field variational Bayesian inference. We assess the model performance on five synthetic noise distribution functions and an experimental MES dataset to perform six wrist movements. The results demonstrate that GMNMF yields low error and high robustness in extracting the movement primitives over four competitive methods for robust cybernetic control.",ar,2022-12-01,IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems,Bayesian inference | Gaussian mixture model (GMM) | humanoid robots | model learning for control | movement primitive | nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF),2-s2.0-85136094651,,,Article,Xie H.,60121275;60028009;60023932;60011019;60010080,Departement Elektrotechniek (ESAT);Yunnan University;University of Technology Sydney;Queensland University of Technology;Nanjing University of Science and Technology,Leuven;Kunming;Sydney;Brisbane;Nanjing,Belgium;China;Australia;Australia;China,6,"Xie, Hongbo;Mengersen, Kerrie;Di, Changan;Zhang, Yongjian;Lipman, Justin;Van Huffel, Sabine",23089708300;6603793565;7003411538;57196210770;8605294200;7004954228,60028009-60011019;60011019;60010080;60010080;60023932;60121275,1 December 2022,21682291,21100285028,21682305,Journal,52,6,,1258-1270,0,,undefined,,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/THMS.2022.3194593

This sensor can acquire contact information by interacting with the environment nonintrusively. This sensor is accompanied by a planning technique to generate exploration trajectories by using mere tactile perception. This technique relies on a hybrid policy for tactile exploration, which includes a proactive informative path planner for object searching, and a reactive Hopf oscillator for contour tracing. Results indicate that the hybrid exploration policy can increase the efficiency of object discovery. Last, scene understanding was facilitated by segmenting objects and classification.

The limited perceptual accuracy of surgeons makes it difficult to precisely position the forceps. Robot technology provides a feasible way to improve the performance of CCC. Methods: To provide real-time and high-precision forceps position feedback to the robot, and extract the expert's operation trajectory for robotic autonomous or assisted capsulorhexis, this paper proposes a forceps tracking method based on Kalman filters to precisely position the forceps. By fusing the inertial sensor data and the visual observation data, the proposed method can obtain forceps depth information and decrease cumulative errors in the inertial sensor data. Results: Experimental validation on an eye phantom is performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed forceps tracking method.

Nevertheless, robotic calibration of workcells is essential because of the geometric differences between the three-dimensional (3D) model environment and the real world. In contrast with previous robot self-calibration methods that use specific sensors, the proposed method requires neither marker settings nor initial positioning of the measurement system. Instead, the geometric feature of interplane relations finds relative differences between the coordinates of the 3D model and those of the real workcell. In addition, an iterative method of estimating world coordinates is introduced to increase the accuracy of the revised robot path. A portable laser scanner acquires 3D point-cloud data, so it can be located near the workcell instead of being pre-fixed, thereby facilitating its use.

How to design and implement a series of tasks in an atypical environment is a challenging issue. If all tasks are implemented using a programming-based approach, the development costs will be huge.

In this paper, we propose novel design guidelines that focus on the respective advantages of programming-based and learning-based approaches and select them so that they complement each other. We use a program-based approach for motions that is rough behavior and a learning-based approach for motion that is required complex interaction between robot and object of robot tasks and are difficult to achieve with a program.

To evaluate the proposal, a course is designed and implemented based on a curriculum with objectives and learning activities centered on the design, construction, and operation of the BEAM robots. In addition, the connection between this proposal and computational thinking is explored. Students learn to recognize each part of robots and how they are related, abstract useful information from an electronic scheme and concretize it in a machine by systematizing their behavior. In addition, thanks to an evaluation of the behavior of the robot, identify the faults and apply the solution, as in the debugging process carried out in software programming. It should be added that BEAM robotics has a sustainable and low-cost aspect, which is used in learning activities where Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is recycled, and students are taught to value and integrate these parts into the design of the robots. A pre and post survey and a respective statistical analysis and evaluation of curricular activities are presented as evidence of the improvement observed in students’ STEM knowledge and skills. In general, the results show that this new teaching tool can promote the STEM curriculum in engineering students and motivate implementation, as a new educational robot, at other academic levels such as secondary and pre-secondary education.",ar,2022-12-01,International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education,BEAM | Educational robotics | STEM | WEEE,2-s2.0-85124279326,,,Article,Boya-Lara C.,60257186,Universidad Interamericana de Panamá,Panama City,Panama,4,"Boya-Lara, Carlos;Saavedra, Doris;Fehrenbach, Aaron;Marquez-Araque, Angel",36975208100;57445064700;57444844700;57445064800,60257186;60257186;60257186;60257186,December 2022,,21100466714,23659440,Journal,19,1,7,,1,SENACYT,APR-IACP-05-19,"Secretaría Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación",8,2022,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41239-021-00311-9
10.1109/TCDS.2021.3137262,A Framework of Improving Human Demonstration Efficiency for Goal-Directed Robot Skill Learning,"Robot learning from humans allows robots to automatically adjust to stochastic and dynamic environments by learning from nontechnical end user's demonstrations, which is best known as robot programming by demonstration, robot learning from demonstration, apprenticeship learning, and imitation learning. Although most of those methods are probabilistic, and their performances intensively depend on the demonstrated data, measuring and evaluating human demonstrations are rarely investigated. A poorly demonstrated data set with useless prior knowledge or redundant demonstrations increases the complexity and time cost of robot learning. To solve these problems, a goal-directed robot skill learning framework named GPm-MOGP is presented. It 1) decides when and where to add a new demonstration by calculating the trajectory uncertainty; 2) determines which demonstration is useless or redundant by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence; 3) implements robot skill learning with a minimum number of demonstrations using a multioutput Gaussian process; and 4) learns orientation uncertainty and representation by combining logarithmic and exponential maps. The proposed framework significantly reduces the demonstrated effort of nontechnical end users who lack an understanding of how and what the robot learns during the demonstrating process. To evaluate the proposed framework, a pick-and-place experiment was designed with five unseen goals to verify the effectiveness of our methods. This experiment is well illustrated with two phases: 1) demonstration efficiency and 2) skill representation and reproduction. The results indicate an improvement of 60% in human demonstration efficiency, compared to common learning from demonstrations (LfD) applications that require at least ten demonstrations, and the robot average success rate of pick-and-place task reaches 85%.",ar,2022-12-01,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems,Computational efficiency | Gaussian processes | human-robot interaction | robot learning,2-s2.0-85122071300,,,Article,Wu H.,60272289;105282049,Guangdong Artificial Intelligence and Digital Economy Laboratory;Guangdong Academy of Sciences,Guangzhou;Guangzhou,China;China,4,"Wu, Hongmin;Yan, Wu;Xu, Zhihao;Zhou, Xuefeng",56650300300;57204598751;57214001897;55743312800,105282049-60272289;105282049;105282049;105282049,1 December 2022,23798920,21100784665,23798939,Journal,14,4,,1743-1754,0,,undefined,,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/TCDS.2021.3137262
10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3088947,Complex Robotic Manipulation via Graph-Based Hindsight Goal Generation,"Reinforcement learning algorithms, such as hindsight experience replay (HER) and hindsight goal generation (HGG), have been able to solve challenging robotic manipulation tasks in multigoal settings with sparse rewards. HER achieves its training success through hindsight replays of past experience with heuristic goals but underperforms in challenging tasks in which goals are difficult to explore. HGG enhances HER by selecting intermediate goals that are easy to achieve in the short term and promising to lead to target goals in the long term. This guided exploration makes HGG applicable to tasks in which target goals are far away from the object's initial position. However, the vanilla HGG is not applicable to manipulation tasks with obstacles because the Euclidean metric used for HGG is not an accurate distance metric in such an environment. Although, with the guidance of a handcrafted distance grid, grid-based HGG can solve manipulation tasks with obstacles, a more feasible method that can solve such tasks automatically is still in demand. In this article, we propose graph-based hindsight goal generation (G-HGG), an extension of HGG selecting hindsight goals based on shortest distances in an obstacle-avoiding graph, which is a discrete representation of the environment. We evaluated G-HGG on four challenging manipulation tasks with obstacles, where significant enhancements in both sample efficiency and overall success rate are shown over HGG and HER.",ar,2022-12-01,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,Hindsight experience replay (HER) | path planning | reinforcement learning (RL) | robotic arm manipulation,2-s2.0-85112216953,,34181552,Article,Bing Z.,60023380;60021182;60019722,Chongqing University;Sun Yat-Sen University;Technische Universität München,Chongqing;Guangzhou;Munich,China;China;Germany,7,"Bing, Zhenshan;Brucker, Matthias;Morin, Fabrice O.;Li, Rui;Su, Xiaojie;Huang, Kai;Knoll, Alois",57194493806;57221322654;57218253007;56399635100;36509271600;56535700000;7102250639,60019722;60019722;60019722;60023380;60023380;60021182;60019722,1 December 2022,2162237X,21100235616,21622388,Journal,33,12,,7863-7876,0,H2020,945539,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,6,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3088947

The commonality of these three seemingly dissimilar tasks is that in order to perform well, the robot needs to excel at the all major AI tasks: perception, control, navigation, strategy and planning. In this work, we focus on the first of these by presenting what is—to our knowledge—the first fully neural vision system for the Nao robot soccer. This is a challenging task, mainly due to the limited computational capabilities of the Nao robot. In this paper, we propose two novel neural network architectures for semantic segmentation and object detection that ensure low-cost inference, while improving accuracy by exploiting the properties of the environment.

Participants consisted of 48 freshmen from a senior high school, including 27 male students and 21 female students. The open-ended questionnaire and the interview for the students were administrated after the i-STEM PjBL. The qualitative data were converted into quantitative data counted by the occurrence frequencies of the codes. The results based on the integration and comparison of the open-ended questionnaire and interview outcomes showed that i-STEM PjBL provided students with positive educational values (including learning acquisition, performance, and perception), but there were also learning challenges in the process. Learning acquisition focused on the basic structure and components of a robot, principles of robot motion, hull structure, principles of sailboat navigation, and skills of designing and assembling sailboats. Learning performance referred that students were satisfied with their hands-on performances and confident of their abilities to perform better in similar disciplines, but did not learn well on programming. Learning perception indicated that students felt interested in i-STEM PjBL materials could acquire knowledge and skills from various fields, PjBL could be helpful to complete works, and principles could be helpful in practice, while programming design learning materials were not enough. Learning challenges indicated that students were unfamiliar with the usage of tools and hands-on operation, and they also felt challenged by programming.

10.3390/su142114528,KidBright: An Open-Source Embedded Programming Platform with a Dedicated Software Framework in Support of Ecosystems for Learning to Code,"The concept of coding at school has enabled educators and parents around the globe to become interested in coding as, these days, coding is regarded as a gateway to computational thinking for children. However, coding education in Thailand appears to lag behind that of many other countries due to the lack of accessible coding learning resources suitable for students as well as the limited number of teachers with coding experience. Regarding these issues, we have developed an open-source hardware-based coding platform named KidBright, based on these requirements: 1. making coding simple for novice learners through the use of graphical blocks with Thai and English support; 2. inspiring young students to develop creative embedded applications with minimal effort; and 3. providing sustainable support for coding education. KidBright is proposed as a coding learning tool that can motivate children to learn to code and develop embedded system projects using its block-based coding environment, the KidBright IDE, in conjunction with its embedded device, the KidBright board. KidBright is distinguished from other embedded programming platforms due to the deployment of a dedicated software framework as the backend of the KidBright IDE. In this article, we introduce KidBright and present the design, architecture, and demonstrations of the software framework, the key roles of which are to conceal low-level hardware issues from learners and to enable makers to develop new command blocks and hardware peripherals in support of KidBright. We claim that, with this particular design, KidBright can help support coding education sustainably.

Heterogeneity is related to different computer and network (communication) architectures. Virtualization can hide and unify heterogeneity. In addition to interprocess communication and synchronization, the unified access and monitoring of computing nodes (devices, computers, processors) is required to handle distributed and parallel systems in a comfortable and easy-to-access manner. Especially in education, the access to and control of a large set of computing nodes are difficult, which lowers the learning curve significantly. In this work, a unified distributed and parallel framework and Web tools are introduced using virtual machines (VM) and Web browsers to control them. The framework enables the control, monitoring, and study of distributed-parallel systems, especially addressing sensor networks and IoT networks. Nodes can be arranged in a graphical drawing world or be script-based. Virtual network nodes are assigned to VM instances that can be created inside the browser using Web worker processes or can be attached to externally running VM instances via a Web control API. New VM instances or processes can be started and controlled instantly. The graphical UI provides access to the internal and external nodes, programming editors, and monitor shells. The VMs can be generic, but in this work, there is a focus on JavaScript and Lua.

Moreover, developing an efficient strategy for a mobile robot to secure navigation is the major issue for autonomous robots. Recently, path planning is a major consideration and research on the topic of autonomous robots in the domain of logistics. Finding the safest and shortest path for mobile robots is the focus. The safe path is determined with the turning point algorithm from the moving robot's starting position to the destination position without obstacles. The efficient path for the static and dynamic environment of the safe path is determined using reinforcement learning. Evolutionary particle swarm optimization (EPSO) has been used to enhance the path planning approach for mobile robots to make this path planning robust and efficient. The proposed evolutionary-based path planning approach for mobile robots satisfies three objectives, such as safe path, efficient path length, and also suitable for static and dynamic environments. Finally, the simulation results prove that the proposed method performs better in finding the safest and shortest path for the mobile robot in the static and dynamic environment and is useful for mobile robot robust tracking.

10.3390/s22228983,An Optimized Probabilistic Roadmap Algorithm for Path Planning of Mobile Robots in Complex Environments with Narrow Channels,"In this paper, we propose a new path planning algorithm based on the probabilistic roadmaps method (PRM), in order to effectively solve the autonomous path planning of mobile robots in complex environments with multiple narrow channels. The improved PRM algorithm mainly improves the density and distribution of sampling points in the narrow channel, through a combination of the learning process of the PRM algorithm and the APF algorithm. We also shortened the required time and path length by optimizing the query process. The first key technology to improve the PRM algorithm involves optimizing the number and distribution of free points and collision-free lines in the free workspace. To ensure full visibility of the narrow channel, we extend the obstacles through the diagonal distance of the mobile robot while ignoring the safety distance. Considering the safety distance during movement, we re-classify the all sampling points obtained by the quasi-random sampling principle into three categories: free points, obstacle points, and adjacent points. Next, we transform obstacle points into the free points of the narrow channel by combining the APF algorithm and the characteristics of the narrow channel, increasing the density of sampling points in the narrow space. Then, we include potential energy judgment into the construction process of collision-free lines shortening the required time and reduce collisions with obstacles. Optimizing the query process of the PRM algorithm is the second key technology. To reduce the required time in the query process, we adapt the bidirectional A* algorithm to query these local paths and obtain an effective path to the target point. We also combine the path pruning technology with the potential energy function to obtain a short path without collisions. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the new PRM path planning technology can improve the density of free points in narrow spaces and achieve an optimized, collision-free path in complex environments with multiple narrow channels.",ar,2022-11-01,Sensors,artificial potential function | narrow channels | path planning | path pruning technology | probabilistic road-map algorithm,2-s2.0-85142676278,,36433584,Article,Qiao L.,60016835,Beijing Institute of Technology,Beijing,China,3,"Qiao, Lijun;Luo, Xiao;Luo, Qingsheng",57217281324;36617867100;7201857725,60016835;60016835;60016835,November 2022,14248220,130124,,Journal,22,22,8983,,1,NKRDPC,2016YFC0803000,National Key Research and Development Program of China,2,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22228983

The proposed method can overcome the slow learning process and improve training data quality inherently in DRL algorithms. The main idea of our approach is as follows. First, we mapped the dynamic programming method to typical optimal path planning problems for mobile robots, and created a new efficient DP-based method to find an exact, analytical, optimal solution for the path planning problem. Then, we used high-quality training data gathered using the DP method for DRL, which greatly improves training data quality and learning efficiency. Next, we established a two-stage reinforcement learning method where, prior to the DRL, we employed extreme learning machines (ELM) to initialize the parameters of actor and critic neural networks to a near-optimal solution in order to significantly improve the learning performance. Finally, we illustrated our method using some typical path planning tasks. The experimental results show that our DRL method can converge much easier and faster than other methods.

The dynamic feature points are removed according to epipolar constraint and dynamic properties of objects between consecutive frames. Since reducing the number of feature points after rejection affects the pose estimation, this paper innovatively combines Cylinder and Plane Extraction (CAPE) planar detection. We generate planes from depth maps and then introduce planar and in-plane point constraints into the nonlinear optimization of SLAM. Finally, the algorithm is tested on the publicly available TUM (RGB-D) dataset, and the average improvement in localization accuracy over ORB-SLAM2, DS-SLAM, and RDMO-SLAM is about 91.95%, 27.21%, and 30.30% under dynamic sequences, respectively. The single-frame tracking time of the whole system is only 42.68 ms, which is 44.1%, being 14.6–34.33% higher than DS-SLAM, RDMO-SLAM, and RDS-SLAM respectively.

10.3390/s22218101,Deep Learning-Based NMPC for Local Motion Planning of Last-Mile Delivery Robot,"Feasible local motion planning for autonomous mobile robots in dynamic environments requires predicting how the scene evolves. Conventional navigation stakes rely on a local map to represent how a dynamic scene changes over time. However, these navigation stakes depend highly on the accuracy of the environmental map and the number of obstacles. This study uses semantic segmentation-based drivable area estimation as an alternative representation to assist with local motion planning. Notably, a realistic 3D simulator based on an Unreal Engine was created to generate a synthetic dataset under different weather conditions. A transfer learning technique was used to train the encoder-decoder model to segment free space from the occupied sidewalk environment. The local planner uses a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme that inputs the estimated drivable space, the state of the robot, and a global plan to produce safe velocity commands that minimize the tracking cost and actuator effort while avoiding collisions with dynamic and static obstacles.

10.1371/journal.pone.0275688,DIY liquid handling robots for integrated STEM education and life science research,"Automation has played a key role in improving the safety, accuracy, and efficiency of manufacturing and industrial processes and has the potential to greatly increase throughput in the life sciences. However, the lack of accessible entry-point automation hardware in life science research and STEM education hinders its widespread adoption and development for life science applications. Here we investigate the design of a low-cost (~$150) open-source DIY Arduino-controlled liquid handling robot (LHR) featuring plastic laser-cut parts. The robot moves in three axes with 0.5 mm accuracy and reliably dispenses liquid down to 20 μL. The open source, modular design allows for flexibility and easy modification. A block-based programming interface (Snap4Arduino) further extends the accessibility of this robot, encouraging adaptation and use by educators, hobbyists and beginner programmers. This robot was co-designed with teachers, and we detail the teachers’ feedback in the context of a qualitative study. We conclude that affordable and accessible LHRs similar to this one could provide a useful educational tool to be deployed in classrooms, and LHR-based curricula may encourage interest in STEM and effectively introduce automation technology to life science enthusiasts.",ar,2022-11-01,PLoS ONE,,2-s2.0-85141477349,,36350791,Article,Li E.,60030162;60012708;60010065;128829316,Columbia University;Stanford University;The University of Arizona;The Miller Institute for Learning with Technology,New York;Palo Alto;Tucson;San Carlos,United States;United States;United States;United States,8,"Li, Ethan;Lam, Amy T.;Fuhrmann, Tamar;Erikson, Len;Wirth, Mike;Miller, Mark L.;Blikstein, Paulo;Riedel-Kruse, Ingmar H.",57218413353;57203966516;55321574900;57956701900;57225996176;55740637600;16229529400;22136039600,60012708;60012708;128829316;60030162;60030162;60030162;128829316;60012708-60010065,November 2022,,10600153309,19326203,Journal,17,11 November,e0275688,,1,NSF,1638070,National Science Foundation,2,2022,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275688
10.1007/s10916-022-01863-7,Human Monkeypox Classification from Skin Lesion Images with Deep Pre-trained Network using Mobile Application,"Recently, human monkeypox outbreaks have been reported in many countries. According to the reports and studies, quick determination and isolation of infected people are essential to reduce the spread rate. This study presents an Android mobile application that uses deep learning to assist this situation. The application has been developed with Android Studio using Java programming language and Android SDK 12. Video images gathered through the mobile device’s camera are dispatched to a deep convolutional neural network that runs on the same device. Camera2 API of the Android platform has been used for camera access and operations. The network then classifies images as positive or negative for monkeypox detection. The network’s training has been carried out using skin lesion images of monkeypox-infected people and other skin lesion images. For this purpose, a publicly available dataset and a deep transfer learning approach have been used. All training and testing steps have been applied on Matlab using different pre-trained networks. Then, the network that has the best accuracy has been recreated and trained using TensorFlow. The TensorFlow model has been adapted to mobile devices by converting to the TensorFlow Lite model. The TensorFlow Lite model has been then embedded into the mobile application together with the TensorFlow Lite library for monkeypox detection. The application has been run on three devices successfully. During the run-time, the inference times have been gathered. 197 ms, 91 ms, and 138 ms average inference times have been observed. The presented system allows people with body lesions to quickly make a preliminary diagnosis. Thus, monkeypox-infected people can be encouraged to act rapidly to see an expert for a definitive diagnosis. According to the test results, the system can classify the images with 91.11% accuracy. In addition, the proposed mobile application can be trained for the preliminary diagnosis of other skin diseases.",ar,2022-11-01,Journal of Medical Systems,Android | Artificial Intelligence | Deep Learning | Mobile Application | Monkeypox | TensorFlow Lite,2-s2.0-85139435711,,36210365,Article,Sahin V.H.,60021494,Sakarya Üniversitesi,Serdivan,Turkey,3,"Sahin, Veysel Harun;Oztel, Ismail;Yolcu Oztel, Gozde",36606739100;56534320100;57918912100,60021494;60021494;60021494,November 2022,01485598,23710,1573689X,Journal,46,11,79,,1,,undefined,,36,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10916-022-01863-7
10.11918/202111074,Salp swarm algorithm based on orthogonal refracted opposition-based learning,"The basic salp swarm algorithm (SSA) may suffer from the drawbacks of slow convergence and low accuracy of high-dimensional solutions. To solve these limitations, we proposed an improved SSA algorithm (OOSSA) which integrates orthogonal refracted opposition-based learning strategy and self-adaptive inertia weight strategy into SSA. In orthogonal refracted learning strategy, the refracted opposition-based learning based on the optical lens imaging principle was employed to enhance the exploration scope of the inverse solution space, which greatly reduced the probability of the algorithm falling into the local optimum. The orthogonal experimental design was used to construct several partial opposite solutions that take the refracted-based inverse values in part of the dimension, so as to deeply mine and preserve the dominant dimensional information of the current individual and the refracted-based opposite individual. In addition, an adaptive inertia weight was introduced in the follower position update phase to effectively improve the follower search pattern and enhance the local exploitation ability of the algorithm. The CEC2017 benchmark functions were employed for simulation experiments. Also, Wilcoxon ' s rank-sum test and Friedman test were performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed OOSSA outperformed the basic SSA, eight improved SSA variants, and nine cutting-edge swarm-based intelligence algorithms. Moreover, the algorithm was applied to an engineering design problem, and results show that the algorithm had better performance than other algorithms in engineering optimization. Finally, an OOSSA-based robot path planning approach was developed for solving the path planning problem in autonomous mobile robots. The proposed algorithm was simulated in three environment settings and compared with other algorithms including particle swarm optimization (PSO), artificial bee colony (ABC), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), firefly algorithm (FA), and SSA. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm could plan the optimal collision-free paths compared with its competitors. The systematic experiments indicate that the OOSSA algorithm can be an effective tool for problem optimization.",ar,2022-11-01,Harbin Gongye Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Harbin Institute of Technology,benchmark functions | engineering design optimization | orthogonal experimental design | path planning | refracted opposition-based learning | salp swarm algorithm | self-adaptive learning,2-s2.0-85139336535,,,Article,Wang Z.,60028009;60018554;60009860;128670424,Yunnan University;Zhengzhou University;Fudan University;Educational and Scientific Institute,Kunming;Zhengzhou;Shanghai;Kunming,China;China;China;China,6,"Wang, Zongshan;Ding, Hongwei;Wang, Jie;Li, Bo;Hou, Peng;Yang, Zhijun",57218489461;35995295900;57201776754;57195397849;57212346949;57188805913,60028009;60028009;60018554;60028009;60009860;60028009-128670424,November 2022,03676234,29708,,Journal,54,11,,122-136,0,,undefined,,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.11918/202111074
10.1016/j.asoc.2022.109621,Camera view planning based on generative adversarial imitation learning in indoor active exploration,"Actively exploring unknown indoor environments using an RGB-D camera is a challenging task, especially when utilizing the feature-based visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) methods. The existence of low-texture scenes, such as narrow corridors and white walls, may lead to frequent tracking failure of indoor features. To avoid tracking failure, while simultaneously ensuring adequate exploration, a novel active vSLAM framework with camera view planning based on generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) is proposed to actively adjust the orientation of the camera during robot motion. First, the Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF-SLAM2 (ORB-SLAM2) method is modified to reconstruct a three-channel navigation map that contains information about obstacles and explored areas. Second, a large number of view planning behaviors of human beings are collected in different indoor environments as the expert demonstration. Last, to make the robot imitate the human searching behaviors, the structures of the actor, critic, and discriminator networks are designed, and the GAIL method is used to train the camera view planning policy. Simulation results on a public dataset of indoor environments show that the proposed GAIL-SLAM framework improves the exploration coverage ratio of unknown environments by an average of 53.08% (34.21% for traditional vs. 87.29% for our proposed). Meanwhile, the number of effective exploration steps before the occurrence of tracking failure increases by 405% (73 for traditional vs. 369 for our proposed) on average, indicating that the rate of tracking failure is effectively reduced.",ar,2022-11-01,Applied Soft Computing,Active vSLAM | Environment exploration | Imitation learning | Tracking failure,2-s2.0-85138455590,S1568494622006706,,Article,Dai X.Y.,60019533;128183492,"Tianjin University;Qingdao Hi-image Technologies Co.,Ltd (Hisense Visual Technology Co.,Ltd.)",Tianjin;Qingdao,China;China,4,"Dai, Xu Yang;Meng, Qing Hao;Jin, Sheng;Liu, Yin Bo",57202955676;22433584000;57214728730;57207473125,60019533;60019533;60019533;128183492,November 2022,15684946,18136,,Journal,129,,109621,,0,,2021M692390,China Postdoctoral Science Foundation,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2022.109621
10.1016/j.engappai.2022.105277,Visually-guided motion planning for autonomous driving from interactive demonstrations,"The successful integration of autonomous robots in real-world environments strongly depends on their ability to reason from context and take socially acceptable actions. Current autonomous navigation systems mainly rely on geometric information and hard-coded rules to induce safe and socially compliant behaviors. Yet, in unstructured urban scenarios these approaches can become costly and suboptimal. In this paper, we introduce a motion planning framework consisting of two components: a data-driven policy that uses visual inputs and human feedback to generate socially compliant driving behaviors (encoded by high-level decision variables), and a local trajectory optimization method that executes these behaviors (ensuring safety). In particular, we employ Interactive Imitation Learning to jointly train the policy with the local planner, a Model Predictive Controller (MPC), which results in safe and human-like driving behaviors. Our approach is validated in realistic simulated urban scenarios. Qualitative results show the similarity of the learned behaviors with human driving. Furthermore, navigation performance is substantially improved in terms of safety, i.e., number of collisions, as compared to prior trajectory optimization frameworks, and in terms of data-efficiency as compared to prior learning-based frameworks, broadening the operational domain of MPC to more realistic autonomous driving scenarios.",ar,2022-11-01,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,Autonomous driving | Deep learning | Human in the loop | Interactive Imitation Learning | Model Predictive Control | Motion planning,2-s2.0-85138443938,S0952197622003323,,Article,Pérez-Dattari R.,60118240,"Department of Cognitive Robotics, TU Delft",Delft,Netherlands,5,"Pérez-Dattari, Rodrigo;Brito, Bruno;de Groot, Oscar;Kober, Jens;Alonso-Mora, Javier",57210793807;57211022915;57222719492;22940629000;37057150200,60118240;60118240;60118240;60118240;60118240,November 2022,09521976,24182,,Journal,116,,105277,,1,NWO,15916,Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2022.105277
10.1016/j.robot.2022.104256,Spatial and temporal features unified self-supervised representation learning networks,"Robot manipulation tasks can be carried out effectively, provided the state representation is satisfactorily detailed. Embodiment difference, Viewpoint difference, and Domain difference are some of the challenges in learning from human demonstration. This work proposes a self-supervised and multi-viewpoint spatial and temporal features unified representation learning method. The algorithm consists of two components: (a) Spatial Component, which learns the setting of the environment, i.e., on which pixels to focus on most to get the best representation of the image regardless of point of view, and (b) Temporal Component that learns how snapshots taken from multiple viewpoints simultaneously (i.e., at the same time-step but from a different viewpoint) are similar and how these snaps are different from snaps taken at a different time-step but same viewpoint. Further, these representations are integrated with the Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to learn accurate behaviors from videos of humans performing the manipulation task. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated by training the robots to learn various manipulation tasks i.e., (a) grab objects (b) lift objects (c) open and close drawers from expert demonstrations provided by humans. The algorithm shows great promise and is highly successful across all the manipulation tasks. The robot learns to pick up objects of various shapes, sizes and colors having different orientations and placements on the table. The robot also successfully learns how to open and close drawers.

10.1111/bjet.13266,"Towards inclusiveness and sustainability of robot programming in early childhood: Child engagement, learning outcomes and teacher perception","The proliferation of screen-free programmable robotics allows teachers to implement age-appropriate integrated activities that can promote child learning and development. However, very scarce is known about the challenges of using programmable robots as a tool to empower children in minority communities. This mixed-methods case study examined a Free Quality Kindergarten situated in a low-income public housing estate in Hong Kong to explore the affordances and challenges of robot programming (RP) in early childhood education (ECE). Both quantitative and qualitative data were generated through videotaped observations, child assessments and teacher interviews to journey with the teaching team as they managed to implement the newly introduced RP curriculum. Child assessment evidence revealed that there was a statistically significant improvement in CT scores over 6 weeks of RP activities, while the pretest–posttest change of child self-regulation scores was nonsignificant. Video analysis results further revealed that children's interaction level with the robot kit significantly predicted the change of self-regulation over time. Qualitative results are presented to explicate the micro, meso and macro conditions that constrain the implementation of RP curriculum, including the following: (a) teachers' limited TPACK in RP education, (b) a disconnect between the RP curriculum and the school-based curriculum, (c) limited resources and (d) the Confucian tradition and cultural barriers. These illustrate the intricacies involved in the implementation of RP education to empower marginalized children in under-resourced ECE settings. This study will help bring systemic change to the ECE field by uncovering ecological difficulties in integrating new technologies to promote inclusiveness and sustainability for the future. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Screen-free robot programming (RP) is beneficial for preschool children in terms of promoting their computational thinking (CT) and executive functioning. RP can be generally engaging for preschool children from a middle-class background. What this paper adds The study is addressing the inclusiveness and sustainability according to the learning needs of kindergarten students, especially those from less privileged backgrounds. The story-based approach to RP can cater to the learning needs and interests of children from a lower socio-economic background, which is likely to enhance their CT skills. Children with a higher level of interaction with the robot kit benefited more from the RP activities in terms of self-regulation skills. This study used multiple methods (ie, video analysis, teacher interview and child assessment) to reveal the effects of micro, meso and macro contexts on RP education in an under-resourced Hong Kong kindergarten. Implications for practice and/or policy RP education should be cautiously prompted in diverse early childhood settings, especially the less privileged institutions, to enhance positive effects. Critical constraints on the use of programmable robots to empower marginalized children should be adequately addressed when trying to integrate RP into early childhood education. Teachers should receive training and continual support in RP-related pedagogical strategies to facilitate and scaffold children's learning.",ar,2022-11-01,British Journal of Educational Technology,child–robot interaction | computational thinking | early childhood education | robot programming | sociocultural influences,2-s2.0-85136317778,,,Article,Yang W.,60026851;60017919;60006541,University of Oxford;The Education University of Hong Kong;The University of Hong Kong,Oxford;Hong Kong;Hong Kong,United Kingdom;China;Hong Kong,3,"Yang, Weipeng;Luo, Haoran;Su, Jiahong",57193330576;57556589900;57443505800,60017919;60026851;60006541,November 2022,00071013,23988,14678535,Journal,53,6,,1486-1510,0,EdUHK,RG 84/2020‐2021R,Education University of Hong Kong,4,2022,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjet.13266
10.1109/TVT.2022.3190557,Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning for RIS-Assisted Indoor Multi-Robot Communication Systems,"Indoor multi-robot communications face two key challenges: one is the severe signal strength degradation caused by blockages (e.g., walls) and the other is the dynamic environment caused by robot mobility. To address these issues, we consider the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to overcome the signal blockage and assist the trajectory design among multiple robots. Meanwhile, the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is adopted to cope with the scarcity of spectrum and enhance the connectivity of robots. Considering the limited battery capacity of robots, we aim to maximize the energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the transmit power of the access point (AP), the phase shifts of the RIS, and the trajectory of robots. A novel federated deep reinforcement learning (F-DRL) approach is developed to solve this challenging problem with one dynamic long-term objective. Through each robot planning its path and downlink power, the AP only needs to determine the phase shifts of the RIS, which can significantly save the computation overhead due to the reduced training dimension. Simulation results reveal the following findings: i) the proposed F-DRL can reduce at least 86% convergence time compared to the centralized DRL; ii) the designed algorithm can adapt to the increasing number of robots; iii) compared to traditional OMA-based benchmarks, NOMA-enhanced schemes can achieve higher energy efficiency.",ar,2022-11-01,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,Federated deep reinforcement learning | indoor robot communication | reconfigurable intelligent surface,2-s2.0-85134252921,,,Article,Luo R.,60016930;60012967,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications;University of British Columbia Okanagan,Beijing;Kelowna,China;Canada,4,"Luo, Ruyu;Ni, Wanli;Tian, Hui;Cheng, Julian",57214912648;57209346343;7202161757;55717581700,60016930;60016930;60016930;60012967,1 November 2022,00189545,17393,19399359,Journal,71,11,,12321-12326,0,NSFC,62071068,National Natural Science Foundation of China,5,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2022.3190557
10.1145/3563296,Can guided decomposition help end-users write larger block-based programs? a mobile robot experiment,"Block-based programming environments, already popular in computer science education, have been successfully used to make programming accessible to end-users in domains like robotics, mobile apps, and even DevOps. Most studies of these applications have examined small programs that fit within a single screen, yet real-world programs often grow large, and editing these large block-based programs quickly becomes unwieldy. Traditional programming language features, like functions, allow programmers to decompose their programs. Unfortunately, both previous work, and our own findings, suggest that end-users rarely use these features, resulting in large monolithic code blocks that are hard to understand. In this work, we introduce a block-based system that provides users with a hierarchical, domain-specific program structure and requires them to decompose their programs accordingly. Through a user study with 92 users, we compared this approach, which we call guided program decomposition, to a traditional system that supports functions, but does not require decomposition. We found that while almost all users could successfully complete smaller tasks, those who decomposed their programs were significantly more successful as the tasks grew larger. As expected, most users without guided decomposition did not decompose their programs, resulting in poor performance on larger problems. In comparison, users of guided decomposition performed significantly better on the same tasks. Though this study investigated only a limited selection of tasks in one specific domain, it suggests that guided decomposition can benefit end-user programmers. While no single decomposition strategy fits all domains, we believe that similar domain-specific sub-hierarchies could be found for other application areas, increasing the scale of code end-users can create and understand.",ar,2022-10-31,Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages,block-based programming | mobile robots | program decomposition,2-s2.0-85168421202,,,Article,Ritschel N.,60010365;60002476,The University of British Columbia;Virginia Commonwealth University,Vancouver;Richmond,Canada;United States,5,"Ritschel, Nico;Fronchetti, Felipe;Holmes, Reid;Garcia, Ronald;Shepherd, David C.",57188721483;57209889079;56220448900;26667650300;7201684174,60010365;60002476;60010365;60010365;60002476,31 October 2022,,21101020042,24751421,Journal,6,OOPSLA2,133,,1,,2024561,National Science Foundation,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3563296

While some research exists on how children learn programming, very little has been written about how they learn the technical skills needed to operate technologies or to fix breakdowns that occur in the code or the machine. The purpose of this study is to explore how children perform technical knowledge in tangible programming environments. Design/methodology/approach: The current study examines the organization of young children’s technical knowledge in the context of a design-based study of Kindergarteners learning to code using robot coding toys, where groups of children collaboratively debugged programs. The authors conducted iterative rounds of qualitative coding of video recordings in kindergarten classrooms and interaction analysis of children using coding robots. Findings: The authors found that as children repaired bugs at the level of the program and at the level of the physical apparatus, they were performing essential technical knowledge; the authors focus on how demonstrating technical knowledge was organized pedagogically and collectively achieved. Originality/value: Drawing broadly from studies of the social organization of technical work in professional settings, we argue that technical knowledge is easy to overlook but essential for learning to repair programs. The authors suggest how tangible programming environments represent pedagogically important contexts for dis-embedding young children’s essential technical knowledge from the more abstract knowledge of programming.",ar,2022-10-24,Information and Learning Science,Computer literacy | Debugging | Early childhood | Interaction analysis | Sociotechnical organization of learning | Tangible programming | Technical knowledge,2-s2.0-85134648839,,,Article,Silvis D.,60031706;60025911,Utah State University;Stanford Graduate School of Education,Logan;Stanford,United States;United States,4,"Silvis, Deborah;Lee, Victor R.;Clarke-Midura, Jody;Shumway, Jessica F.",57200634934;36020199700;36631659800;56027707500,60031706;60025911;60031706;60031706,24 October 2022,23985348,21100805777,,Journal,123,9-10,,577-600,0,NSF,1842116,National Science Foundation,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.1108/ILS-12-2021-0109
10.3389/frvir.2022.968312,RAISE: Robotics &amp; AI to improve STEM and social skills for elementary school students,"The authors present the design and implementation of an exploratory virtual learning environment that assists children with autism (ASD) in learning science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills along with improving social-emotional and communication skills. The primary contribution of this exploratory research is how educational research informs technological advances in triggering a virtual AI companion (AIC) for children in need of social-emotional and communication skills development. The AIC adapts to students’ varying levels of needed support. This project began by using puppetry control (human-in-the-loop) of the AIC, assisting students with ASD in learning basic coding, practicing their social skills with the AIC, and attaining emotional recognition and regulation skills for effective communication and learning. The student is given the challenge to program a robot, Dash™, to move in a square. Based on observed behaviors, the puppeteer controls the virtual agent’s actions to support the student in coding the robot. The virtual agent’s actions that inform the development of the AIC include speech, facial expressions, gestures, respiration, and heart color changes coded to indicate emotional state. The paper provides exploratory findings of the first 2 years of this 5-year scaling-up research study. The outcomes discussed align with a common approach of research design used for students with disabilities, called single case study research. This type of design does not involve random control trial research; instead, the student acts as her or his own control subject. Students with ASD have substantial individual differences in their social skill deficits, behaviors, communications, and learning needs, which vary greatly from the norm and from other individuals identified with this disability. Therefore, findings are reported as changes within subjects instead of across subjects.

In this letter, we focus on the multi-robot coverage path planning (mCPP) problem in large-scale planar areas with random dynamic interferers in the environment, where the robots have limited resources. We introduce a worker-station MRS consisting of multiple workers with limited resources for actual work, and one station with enough resources for resource replenishment. We aim to solve the mCPP problem for the worker-station MRS by formulating it as a fully cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning problem. Then we propose an end-to-end decentralized online planning method, which simultaneously solves coverage planning for workers and rendezvous planning for station. Our method manages to reduce the influence of random dynamic interferers on planning, while the robots can avoid collisions with them.

In the details, the proposed solution relies on a Task and Motion Planning approach based on a two-level architecture: the high-level is a Task Planner aimed at finding the optimal objects sequence to relocate, according to a metric based on the objects weight; the low-level is a Motion Planner in charge of planning the end-effector path for reaching the specific objects taking into account the robot physical constraints. The high-level task planner is a Reinforcement Learning agent, trained using the information coming from the low-level Motion Planner. In this work we consider the Q-Tree algorithm, which is based on a dynamic tree structure inspired by the Q-learning technique.

To improve procedure outcomes and reduce radiation exposure, we propose steps towards a fully automated approach for steerable guidewire navigation within vessels. In this letter, we utilize fluoroscopic images to fully reconstruct 3-D printed phantom vasculature models by using a shape-from-silhouette algorithm. The reconstruction is subsequently de-noised using a deep learning-based encoder-decoder network and morphological filtering. This volume is used to model the environment for guidewire traversal. Following this, we present a novel method to plan an optimal path for guidewire traversal in three-dimensional vascular models through the use of slice planes and a modified hybrid A-star algorithm.

Revealing spatial distribution from terrain geometry to rover slip behavior is key to assessing prospective traversability, but is hindered by insufficient in situ measurements on hazardous states due to conservative rover traverses. To achieve a more accurate prediction, this letter proposes a framework that actively learns latent traversability by exploring informative terrain under the constraints of stochastic rover slip. With a Gaussian process (GP) modeling the spatial distribution, we devise an iterative two-stage framework that gradually refines the model estimation, combining risk-aware informative path planning and GP updates by taking in situ measurements. The path planning stage employs our designed sampling-based algorithm to generate informative trajectories with fault-tolerant risk inference, while the GP is cautiously updated with traverse data to avoid rover immobilization. Chance constraint formulation is exploited in the framework to infer the stochastic reachability of informative regions. Through GP estimates reducing uncertainty, the algorithm incrementally reaches informative yet hazardous states along feasible trajectories. Simulation studies in rough terrain environments demonstrate that the proposed framework gathers informative traverse data while averting rover stuck situations to estimate the latent traversability model.",ar,2022-10-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Field robots | motion and path planning | probabilistic inference | space robotics and automation,2-s2.0-85139407897,,,Article,Endo M.,60025997,Keio University,Tokyo,Japan,2,"Endo, Masafumi;Ishigami, Genya",57918717200;9746198000,60025997;60025997,1 October 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,4,,11855-11862,0,,undefined,,2,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3207554

Grasp poses inherently have multi-modal structures, that is, continuous and discrete parameters. Mixed-integer programming (MIP) is one method that solves these multi-modal problems. However, searching for all the discrete parameters costs considerable time. Therefore, by learning the feasibility of each mode from the geometric variables, the problem can be solved efficiently within a given time limit. The feasibility of grasp poses is related to the pose of the object and nearby obstacles. Utilizing this information, we introduce learned geometric feasibility (LGF), which prioritizes the integer search of MIP. LGF is scalable to multiple robots and environments because it learns the feasibility using object-oriented information. It has been demonstrated to improve the number of solved MIP problems within the time limit and to be applicable to various environmental settings.",ar,2022-10-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Deep learning in grasping and manipulation | grasping | manipulation planning,2-s2.0-85137576105,,,Article,Park S.,60120480,Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology,Seoul,South Korea,4,"Park, Suhan;Kim, Hyoung Cheol;Baek, Jiyeong;Park, Jaeheung",57207943864;57710245400;57218835526;55716930600,60120480;60120480;60120480;60120480,1 October 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,4,,11545-11552,0,,undefined,,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3202633

Human-robot cooperation combining the advantages of human and robot is an effective way to solve the complex assembly. However, the poor reusability of historical assembly knowledge reduces the adaptability of assembly system to different tasks. For cross-domain strategy transfer, we propose a human-robot cooperative assembly (HRCA) framework which consists of three main modules: expression of HRCA strategy, transferring of HRCA strategy, and adaptive planning of motion path. Based on the analysis of subject capability and component properties, the HRCA strategy suitable for specific tasks is designed. Then the reinforcement learning is established to optimize the parameters of target encoder for feature extraction.

There are tasks in lives that require the motion of the robot to meet some certain pose constraints that have not been implemented through the soft arm, like delivering a glass of water. Because the workspace of the soft arm is affected by the loads or interaction, it is difficult to implement this task through the motion planning method. In this letter, we propose a Q-learning based approach to address the problem, directly achieving motion control with constraints under loads and interaction without planning. We first generate a controller for the soft arm based on Q-learning, which can operate the arm while satisfying the pose constraints when the arm is neither loaded nor interacted with the environment. Then, we introduce a process that adjusts corresponding Q values in the controller, which allows the controller to operate the arm with an unknown load or interaction while still satisfying the pose constraints.

Inspired by recent advances in 3D modeling, e.g. NeRF, we propose a method to represent objects as continuous functions upon which constraint features are defined and jointly trained.

To address this problem, robots must therefore not only be capable of learning how to complete novel tasks at run-time, but the solutions to these tasks must also be informed by the needs of the user. In this letter we demonstrate how behaviour trees, a well established control architecture in the fields of gaming and robotics, can be used in conjunction with natural language instruction to provide a robust and modular control architecture for instructing autonomous agents to learn and perform novel complex tasks. We also show how behaviour trees generated using our approach can be generalised to novel scenarios, and can be re-used in future learning episodes to create increasingly complex behaviours.

However, a fundamental challenge for the utilization of affordance knowledge lies in its generalization to unknown objects and environments. In this letter we present a new method for learning causal relationships between object properties and object affordances which can be transferred to other environments. Our approach, implemented on a PR2 robot, generates hypotheses of property-affordance models in a toy environment based on human demonstrations that are subsequently tested through interventional experiments. The system relies on information theory to choose experiments for maximal information gain, performs them self-supervised and uses the observed outcome to iteratively refine the set of candidate causal models. The learned causal knowledge is human-interpretable in the form of graphical models, stored in the knowledge graph. We validate our method through a task requiring affordance knowledge transfer to three different unknown environments.

10.1109/LRA.2022.3196886,NFOMP: Neural Field for Optimal Motion Planner of Differential Drive Robots With Nonholonomic Constraints,"Optimal motion planning is one of the most critical problems in mobile robotics. On the one hand, classical sampling-based methods propose asymptotically optimal solutions to this problem. However, these planners cannot achieve smooth and short trajectories in reasonable calculation time. On the other hand, optimization-based methods are able to generate smooth and plain trajectories in a variety of scenarios, including a dense human crowd. However, modern optimization-based methods use the precomputed signed distance function for collision loss estimation, and it limits the application of these methods for general configuration spaces, including a differential drive non-circular robot with non-holonomic constraints. Moreover, optimization-based methods lack the ability to handle U-shaped or thin obstacles accurately. We propose to improve the optimization methods in two aspects. Firstly, we developed an obstacle neural field model to estimate collision loss; training this model together with trajectory optimization allows improving collision loss continuously, while achieving more feasible and smoother trajectories. Secondly, we forced the trajectory to consider non-holonomic constraints by adding Lagrange multipliers to the trajectory loss function. We applied our method for solving the optimal motion planning problem for differential drive robots with non-holonomic constraints, benchmarked our solution, and proved that the novel planner generates smooth, short, and plain trajectories perfectly suitable for a robot to follow, and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by 25% on normalized curvature and by 75% on the number of cusps in the MovingAI environment.",ar,2022-10-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Deep learning methods | motion and path planning | nonholonomic motion planning,2-s2.0-85135741581,,,Article,Kurenkov M.,60107405,Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology,Moscow,Russian Federation,7,"Kurenkov, Mikhail;Potapov, Andrei;Savinykh, Alena;Yudin, Evgeny;Kruzhkov, Evgeny;Karpyshev, Pavel;Tsetserukou, Dzmitry",57209881606;57748918200;57747942400;57748918100;57748599000;57210793335;15726820800,60107405;60107405;60107405;60107405;60107405;60107405;60107405,1 October 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,4,,10991-10998,0,РФФИ,21-58-15006,Russian Foundation for Basic Research,2,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3196886
10.1109/LRA.2022.3196164,Learning Perceptual Concepts by Bootstrapping From Human Queries,"When robots operate in human environments, it's critical that humans can quickly teach them new concepts: object-centric properties of the environment that they care about (e.g., objects near, upright, etc). However, teaching a new perceptual concept from high-dimensional robot sensor data (e.g., point clouds) is demanding, requiring an unrealistic amount of human labels. To address this, we propose a framework called Perceptual Concept Bootstrapping (PCB). First, we leverage the inherently lower-dimensional privileged information, e.g., object poses and bounding boxes, available from a simulator only at training time to rapidly learn a low-dimensional, geometric concept from minimal human input. Second, we treat this low-dimensional concept as an automatic labeler to synthesize a large-scale high-dimensional data set with the simulator. With these two key ideas, PCB alleviates human label burden while still learning perceptual concepts that work with real sensor input where no privileged information is available. We evaluate PCB for learning spatial concepts that describe object state or multi-object relationships, and show it achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods. We also demonstrate the utility of the learned concepts in motion planning tasks on a 7-DoF Franka Panda robot.",ar,2022-10-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,human factors and human-in-the-loop | Human-centered robotics | visual learning,2-s2.0-85135735798,,,Article,Bobu A.,60025038;60015481;128571602;128343326,"University of California, Berkeley;University of Washington;NVIDIA Seattle Robotics Lab;Meta AI",Berkeley;Seattle;Redmond;New York,United States;United States;United States;United States,7,"Bobu, Andreea;Paxton, Chris;Yang, Wei;Sundaralingam, Balakumar;Chao, Yu Wei;Cakmak, Maya;Fox, Dieter",57191698884;56176594500;57221215081;57202353287;55267140900;22940323800;7402074129,60025038;128571602-128343326;128571602;128571602;128571602;128571602-60015481;128571602-60015481,1 October 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,4,,11260-11267,0,,undefined,,2,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3196164

Robots can perform more and more manipulation tasks that are still done by humans, and there is a growing number of publications on the topics of (1) performing tasks that always require contact and (2) mitigating uncertainty by leveraging the environment in tasks that, under perfect information, could be performed without contact. The recent trends have seen robots perform tasks earlier left for humans, such as massage, and in the classical tasks, such as peg-in-hole, there is a more efficient generalization to other similar tasks, better error tolerance, and faster planning or learning of the tasks. Thus, in this survey we cover the current stage of robots performing such tasks, starting from surveying all the different in-contact tasks robots can perform, observing how these tasks are controlled and represented, and finally presenting the learning and planning of the skills required to complete these tasks.",ar,2022-10-01,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,Compliance | Impedance control | In-contact tasks | Manipulation in contact | Robotic manipulation,2-s2.0-85135705519,S0921889022001312,,Article,Suomalainen M.,60103653;60012954;60000990,Aalto University;Oulun Yliopisto;Chalmers University of Technology,Espoo;Oulu;Gothenburg,Finland;Finland;Sweden,3,"Suomalainen, Markku;Karayiannidis, Yiannis;Kyrki, Ville",57192428853;8693741600;6603653623,60012954;60000990;60103653,October 2022,09218890,18079,,Journal,156,,104224,,1,H2020,101020977,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,19,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2022.104224

However, state-of-the-art deep RL approaches typically lack safety guarantees, especially when the robot and environment models are unknown. To justify widespread deployment, robots must respect safety constraints without sacrificing performance. Thus, we propose a Black-box Reachability-based Safety Layer (BRSL) with three main components: (1) data-driven reachability analysis for a black-box robot model, (2) a trajectory rollout planner that predicts future actions and observations using an ensemble of neural networks trained online, and (3) a differentiable polytope collision check between the reachable set and obstacles that enables correcting unsafe actions.

10.1109/LRA.2022.3192765,MR-TopoMap: Multi-Robot Exploration Based on Topological Map in Communication Restricted Environment,"Multi-robot exploration in unknown environments is a fundamental task for a multi-robot system, involving inter-robot communication through messages among the robots. However, in a restricted communication environment, the limited communication resources become the system's bottleneck due to a large amount of data in the occupancy grid map. Hence, to enhance multi-agent exploration in communication-constrained environments, this letter develops a method to build topological maps while the robot moves in the environment and an exploration strategy based on the created topological map. The latter map comprises a set of vertices and edges connecting the vertices, where each vertex represents a specific area embedded with a descriptor extracted by visually observing this area and recognizing it utilizing descriptors. Each robot has its local grid map stored for path planning, not shared between them. Considering the exploration task, a robot's ability to choose a proper direction depends on the other robot's locations and the unexplored areas. Our exploration framework is evaluated on the Gazebo simulator and real robots, increasing the exploration efficiency by 23%∼77. Compared with the occupancy grid map scheme, our method's data transfer is reduced by 84%∼90%.",ar,2022-10-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,mapping | Multi-robot SLAM | multi-robot systems,2-s2.0-85135233122,,,Article,Zhang Z.,60025278,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,5,"Zhang, Zhaoliang;Yu, Jincheng;Tang, Jiahao;Xu, Yuanfan;Wang, Yu",57219185533;57189232390;57431619700;57210257201;57431023900,60025278;60025278;60025278;60025278;60025278,1 October 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,4,,10794-10801,0,,undefined,,4,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3192765

10.1109/LRA.2022.3192800,Smooth Model Predictive Path Integral Control Without Smoothing,"We present a sampling-based control approach that can generate smooth actions for general nonlinear systems without external smoothing algorithms. Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control has been utilized in numerous robotic applications due to its appealing characteristics to solve non-convex optimization problems. However, the stochastic nature of sampling-based methods can cause significant chattering in the resulting commands. Chattering becomes more prominent in cases where the environment changes rapidly, possibly even causing the MPPI to diverge. To address this issue, we propose a method that seamlessly combines MPPI with an input-lifting strategy. In addition, we introduce a new action cost to smooth control sequence during trajectory rollouts while preserving the information theoretic interpretation of MPPI, which was derived from non-affine dynamics. We validate our method in two nonlinear control tasks with neural network dynamics: a pendulum swing-up task and a challenging autonomous driving task. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the MPPI baselines with additionally applied smoothing algorithms.",ar,2022-10-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,autonomous vehicle navigation | field robots | model learning for control | Optimization and optimal control | planning under uncertainty,2-s2.0-85134870966,,,Article,Kim T.,60068694;60013682,Agency for Defense Development;Seoul National University,Daejeon;Seoul,South Korea;South Korea,5,"Kim, Taekyung;Park, Gyuhyun;Kwak, Kiho;Bae, Jihwan;Lee, Wonsuk",57222378211;57188639687;56465469000;57303733700;57189395312,60068694;60068694-60013682;60068694;60068694;60068694,1 October 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,4,,10406-10413,1,,undefined,,7,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3192800

Symbolic methods build modular systems with semantic parsing and task planning modules for producing sequences of actions from natural language requests. Modern connectionist methods employ deep neural networks that learn visual and linguistic features for mapping inputs to a sequence of low-level actions, in an end-to-end fashion. The hybrid, modular system blends these two approaches to create a modular framework: it formulates instruction following as symbolic goal learning via deep neural networks followed by task planning via symbolic planners. Connectionist and symbolic modules are bridged with Planning Domain Definition Language. The vision-and-language learning network predicts its goal representation, which is sent to a planner for producing a task-completing action sequence. For improving the flexibility of natural language, we further incorporate implicit human intents with explicit human instructions. To learn generic features for vision and language, we propose to separately pretrain vision and language encoders on scene graph parsing and semantic textual similarity tasks. Benchmarking evaluates the impacts of different components of, or options for, the vision-and-language learning model and shows the effectiveness of pretraining strategies.

The two approaches differ in handling inequality constraints stemming from bounds on motion derivatives, collision avoidance, tracking error, etc. Our first optimizer augments the inequalities into the cost function, while the second one relies on a novel GPU accelerated batch projection algorithm. We adopt a learning-based approach to ensure a fast query of the occlusion cost arising from the environment. Specifically, we train a neural network to compute the occlusion directly from the point obstacles generated from LiDAR or RGB-D sensors. Our learned occlusion model can be queried up to 3x faster than the approaches based on distance computation from occupancy or voxel maps. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following aspects. First, our optimizers do not require any explicit map building and can thus adapt on the fly to the changes in the environment.

Therefore, the ability of robots to explain such failures is paramount for interacting with humans to increase trust and transparency. To achieve this skill, the main challenges addressed in this letter are I) acquiring enough data to learn a cause-effect model of the environment and II) generating causal explanations based on the obtained model. We address I) by learning a causal Bayesian network from simulation data. Concerning II), we propose a novel method that enables robots to generate contrastive explanations upon task failures. The explanation is based on setting the failure state in contrast with the closest state that would have allowed for successful execution. This state is found through breadth-first search and is based on success predictions from the learned causal model. We assessed our method in two different scenarios I) stacking cubes and II) dropping spheres into a container. The obtained causal models reach a sim2real accuracy of 70% and 72%, respectively.

In such conditions, non-prehensile actions could help to increase such affordances. We propose a multi-fingered push-grasping policy that creates enough space for the fingers to wrap around an object to perform a stable power grasp, using a single primitive action. Our approach learns a direct mapping from visual observations to actions and is trained in a fully end-to-end manner. To achieve a more efficient learning, we decouple the action space by learning separately the robot hand pose and finger configuration. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that the proposed push-grasping policy achieves higher grasp success rate over baselines and it can generalize to unseen objects.

Because semantic segmentation networks fail to generalize well to unseen environments, the agent collects images of the new environment which are then used for self-supervised domain adaptation. We formulate this as an informative path planning problem, and present a novel information gain that leverages uncertainty extracted from the semantic model to safely collect relevant data. As domain adaptation progresses, these uncertainties change over time and the rapid learning feedback of our system drives the agent to collect different data.

High-quality code summaries could effectively facilitate program comprehension and software maintenance. A good code summary is supposed to have the following characteristics: complete information, correct meaning, and consistent description. In recent years, numerous approaches have been proposed for code summarization, but it is still very challenging for developers to automatically learn the complex semantics from the source code and generate complete, correct and consistent code summaries. Objective: In this paper, we propose KGCodeSum, a novel keyword-guided abstractive code summarization approach that incorporates structural and contextual information. Methods: To improve summaries’ quality, we leverage both the structural information embedded in code itself and the contextual information from related code snippets. Meanwhile, we make use of keywords to guide summaries’ generation to guarantee the code summaries contain key information. Finally, we propose a new dynamic vocabulary strategy which can effectively resolve the UNK problems in code summaries. Results: Through our evaluation on the large-scale benchmark datasets with 2.1 million java method-comment pairs and 1.1 million C/C++ function-summary pairs, We have observed that our approach could generate better code summaries than existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of completeness, correctness and consistency. In addition, we also find that incorporating the dynamic vocabulary strategy into our approach could significantly save time and space in the model training process. Conclusion: Our KGCodeSum approach could effectively generate code summaries.",ar,2022-10-01,Information and Software Technology,Deep learning | Dynamic vocabulary | Encoder–decoder | Information incorporation | Source code summarization,2-s2.0-85133249092,S0950584922001215,,Article,Cheng W.,60010591,Central China Normal University,Wuhan,China,4,"Cheng, Wuyan;Hu, Po;Wei, Shaozhi;Mo, Ran",57215295094;13805402500;57218866724;55892902900,60010591;60010591;60010591;60010591,October 2022,09505849,18732,,Journal,150,,106987,,0,NSFC,YB135-149,National Natural Science Foundation of China,2,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2022.106987

In this respect, we propose a complete online kinematic control framework for dual-arm robots operating in unstructured industrial settings. We base our approach on admittance control in the cooperative task space. Regulating internal and external efforts offer safe bimanual task execution and enables physical interaction. We implement a hierarchical quadratic programming architecture that applies a prioritization of tasks: most efforts are concentrated on the proper tracking of relative motions of the arms, which is the most critical for safety reasons.

This article proposes a novel hierarchical human-in-the-loop paradigm that aims to produce suitable assistance powers for cable-driven lower limb exosuits to aid the ankle joint in pushing off the ground. It includes two primary loop layers: impedance learning in the external loop and human-in-the-loop adaptive management in the inner loop. Considering unknown terrains, its impedance model can be transferred to a quadratic programming problem with specified constraints, which a designed primal-dual optimization prototype then solves. Then, the presented impedance learning strategy is introduced to regulate the impedance model with the adaptive assistant powers for humans on different terrains. An adaptive controller is designed in the inner loop to balance the nonlinearities and compliance existing in the human-exosuit coexistence, while the robust mechanism compensates for disturbances to facilitate trajectory management without employing the general regressor. The advantage of the proposed technique over conventional solutions with fixed impedance parameters is that it can improve human walking performance over different terrains.

In real-world scenarios, where environments can be complex and nonhomogeneous, a robot needs to be able to gauge whether a state will be in collision with various objects in order to meet some safety metrics. The collision detector should be computationally efficient and, ideally, analytically differentiable to facilitate stable and rapid gradient descent during optimization. However, methods today lack an elegant approach to detect collision differentiably, relying rather on numerical gradients that can be unstable. We present DiffCo, the first, fully autodifferentiable, nonparametric model for collision detection. Its nonparametric behavior allows one to compute collision boundaries on the fly and update them, requiring no pretraining and allowing it to update continuously in dynamic environments. It provides robust gradients for trajectory optimization via backpropagation and is often 10-100 times faster to compute than its geometric counterparts.

10.1007/s10489-022-03191-2,Robot navigation in a crowd by integrating deep reinforcement learning and online planning,"Navigating mobile robots along time-efficient and collision-free paths in crowds is still an open and challenging problem. The key is to build a profound understanding of the crowd for mobile robots, which is the basis of a proactive and foresighted policy. However, since the interaction mechanisms among pedestrians are complex and sophisticated, it is difficult to describe and model them accurately. For the excellent approximation capability of deep neural networks, deep reinforcement learning is a promising solution to the problem. However, current model-free learning-based approaches in crowd navigation always neglect planning and still lead to reactive collision avoidance policies and shortsighted behaviors. Meanwhile, most model-based learning-based approaches are based on state values, imposing a substantial computational burden. To address these problems, we propose a graph-based deep reinforcement learning method, social graph-based double dueling deep Q-network (SG-D3QN), that (i) introduces a social attention mechanism to extract an efficient graph representation for the crowd-robot state, (ii) extends the previous state value approximator to a state-action value approximator, (iii) further optimizes the state-action value approximator with simulated experiences generated by the learned environment model, and (iv) then proposes a human-like decision-making process by integrating model-free reinforcement learning and online planning. Experimental results indicate that our approach helps the robot understand the crowd and achieves a high success rate of more than 0.99 in the crowd navigation task. Compared with previous state-of-the-art algorithms, our approach achieves better performance. Furthermore, with the human-like decision-making process, our approach incurs less than half of the computational cost.",ar,2022-10-01,Applied Intelligence,Crowd navigation | Deep reinforcement learning | Mobile robot | Online planning,2-s2.0-85126386224,,,Article,Zhou Z.,60024350,National University of Defense Technology China,Changsha,China,6,"Zhou, Zhiqian;Zhu, Pengming;Zeng, Zhiwen;Xiao, Junhao;Lu, Huimin;Zhou, Zongtan",57207730011;57218710261;55832912100;49964924600;55729801700;8974315300,60024350;60024350;60024350;60024350;60024350;60024350,October 2022,0924669X,23674,15737497,Journal,52,13,,15600-15616,0,NSFC,61773393,National Natural Science Foundation of China,12,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10489-022-03191-2

In this article, we propose a practical and theoretically justified approach to maintain safety in the presence of dynamics uncertainty. Our approach leverages Bayesian meta-learning with last-layer adaptation. The expressiveness of neural-network features trained offline, paired with efficient last-layer online adaptation, enables the derivation of tight confidence sets, which contract around the true dynamics as the model adapts online. We exploit these confidence sets to plan trajectories that guarantee the safety of the system. Our approach handles problems with high dynamics uncertainty, where reaching the goal safely is potentially initially infeasible, by first exploring to gather data and reduce uncertainty, before autonomously exploiting the acquired information to safely perform the task. Under reasonable assumptions, we prove that our framework guarantees the high-probability satisfaction of all constraints at all times jointly, i.e., over the total task duration. This theoretical analysis also motivates two regularizers of last-layer meta-learning models that improve online adaptation capabilities as well as performance by reducing the size of the confidence sets.

10.1109/TASE.2021.3128639,A Self-Supervised Learning-Based 6-DOF Grasp Planning Method for Manipulator,"To realize a robust robotic grasping system for unknown objects in an unstructured environment, large amounts of grasp data and 3D model data for the object are required; the sizes of these data directly affect the rate of successful grasps. To reduce the time cost of data acquisition and labeling and increase the rate of successful grasps, we developed a self-supervised learning mechanism to control grasp tasks performed by manipulators. First, a manipulator automatically collects the point cloud for the objects from multiple perspectives to increase the efficiency of data acquisition. The complete point cloud for the objects is obtained using the hand-eye vision of the manipulator and the truncated signed distance function algorithm. Then, the point cloud data for the objects are used to generate a series of six-degrees-of-freedom grasp poses, and the force-closure decision algorithm is used to add the grasp quality label to each grasp pose to realize the automatic labeling of grasp data. Finally, the point cloud in the gripper closing area corresponding to each grasp pose is obtained and used to train the grasp-quality classification model for the manipulator. The results of performing actual grasping experiments demonstrate that the proposed self-supervised learning method can increase the rate of successful grasps for the manipulator. Note to Practitioners-Most of the existing grasp planning methods of the manipulator are based on public datasets or simulation data to train model algorithms. Owing to the limited types of objects, the limited amount of data in the public datasets, and the lack of real sensor noise in the simulation data, the robustness of the trained algorithm model is insufficient, and it is difficult to apply to unstructured production environments. To solve the above problems, we propose a 6-DOF capture planning method based on self-supervised learning and introduce a self-supervised learning mechanism to solve the problem of grasp data acquisition in real scenes. The manipulator automatically collects object data from multiple perspectives, performs desktop-level 3D reconstruction, and finally uses the force-closure decision algorithm to automatically label the data in order to realize automatic acquisition and labeling of the grasp data in a real scenario. Preliminary experiments show that this method can obtain high-quality grasp data and can be applied to grasp operations in real multi-target and cluttered environments. However, it has not been tested in actual production environments. This paper focuses on the data acquisition module in the 6-DOF grasp planning framework.

Current off-policy policy gradient methods either suffer from high bias or high variance, delivering often unreliable estimates. The price of inefficiency becomes evident in real-world scenarios such as interaction-driven robot learning, where the success of RL has been rather limited, and a very high sample cost hinders straightforward application. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric Bellman equation, which can be solved in closed form. The solution is differentiable w.r.t the policy parameters and gives access to an estimation of the policy gradient. In this way, we avoid the high variance of importance sampling approaches, and the high bias of semi-gradient methods.

However, RL heavily relies on the reward function, and the agent merely follows the policy to maximize rewards but lacks reasoning ability. As a result, RL may not be suitable for long-horizon robotic tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework, called multiple state spaces reasoning reinforcement learning (SRRL), to endow the agent with the primary reasoning capability. First, we abstract the implicit and latent links between multiple state spaces. Then, we embed historical ob-servations through a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to preserve long-term memories and dependen-cies. The proposed SRRL’s ability of abstraction and long-term memory enables agents to execute long-horizon robotic searching and planning tasks more quickly and reasonably by exploiting the correlation between radio frequency identification (RFID) sensing properties and the environment occupation map. We experimentally validate the efficacy of SRRL in a visual game-based simulation environment.

10.1109/TITS.2022.3150328,How Rough Is the Path? Terrain Traversability Estimation for Local and Global Path Planning,"Perception and interpretation of the terrain is essential for robot navigation, particularly in off-road areas, where terrain characteristics can be highly variable. When planning a path, features such as the terrain gradient and roughness should be considered, and they can jointly represent the traversability cost of the terrain. Despite this range of contributing factors, most cost maps are currently binary in nature, solely indicating traversible versus non-traversible areas. This work presents a joint local and global planning methodology for building continuous cost maps using LIDAR, based on a novel traversability representation of the environment. We investigate two approaches. The first, a statistical approach, computes terrain cost directly from the point cloud. The second, a learning-based approach, predicts an IMU response solely from geometric point cloud data using a 2D-Convolutional-LSTM neural network. This allows us to estimate the cost of a patch without directly driving over it, based on a data set that maps IMU signals to point cloud patches. Based on the terrain analysis, two continuous cost maps are generated to jointly select the optimal path considering distance and traversability cost for local navigation. We present a real-time terrain analysis strategy applicable for local planning, and furthermore demonstrate the straightforward application of the same approach in batch mode for global planning. Off-road autonomous driving experiments in a large and hybrid site illustrate the applicability of the method.

10.1016/j.mfglet.2022.07.111,Reinforcement Learning Enabled Self-Homing of Industrial Robotic Manipulators in Manufacturing,"Industrial robotics has been playing a major role in manufacturing across all types of industries. One common task of robotic cells in manufacturing is called homing, a step that enables a robotic arm to return to its initial / home position (HPos) from anywhere in a robotic cell, without collision or experiencing robot singularities while respecting its joint limits. In almost all industrial robotic cells, an operation cycle starts from, and ends to HPos. The home position also works as a safe state for a cycle to restart when an alarm or fault occurs within the cell. When an alarm occurs, the robot configuration in the cell is unpredictable, thus challenging to bring the robot, autonomously and with safety at HPos and restart the operation. This paper presents a non-vision, reinforcement learning-based approach of a parallel-agent setting to enable self-homing capability in industrial robotic cells, eliminating the need of manual programming of robot manipulators. This approach assumes the sensing of an unknown robotic cell environment pre-encoded in the state definition so that the policies learned can be transferred without further training. The agents are trained in a simulation environment generated by the mechanical design of an actual robotic cell to increase the accuracy of mapping the real environment to the simulated one. The approach explores the impact of certain curriculum on the agent's learning and evaluates two choices, compared to a non-curriculum baseline. A parallel-agent, multi-process training setting is employed to enhance performance in exploring the state space, where experiences are shared among the agents via shared memory. Upon deployment, all agents are involved with their respective policies in a collective manner.

10.1016/j.mfglet.2022.07.118,A Common First-Year Undergraduate Engineering Course in Manufacturing based on Industrial Robots and Flipped Classroom,"The pedagogy of a first-year engineering course in manufacturing is presented. This course entitled Manufacturing and Society involves collaboration with social science, is based on industrial robots as the central theme to attract students’ interests and utilizes the flipped classroom approach for delivery. We hypothesize that, in one semester, recent high school graduates will be able to gain knowledge in manufacturing by learning the computer-aided engineering (CAD) software, applying CAD to design a penholder, fabricating the penholder using additive manufacturing and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software, programming the robot to create a toolpath for the pen, drawing using the pen on the penholder guided by a robot, and elaborating on impacts of robotic painting on society from a social science perspective. This course is designed to give students, regardless of their intended major in engineering, broad knowledge in manufacturing via 10 engineering, 3 social science, and 10 technical communication lectures; 8 labs; and 4 projects. The social science lectures and discussions focus on how knowledge about society can be used to inform design and manufacturing decisions, social science research methods for understanding how engineers and technology can impact people's lives, and changing trends in work, the workplace, and the future workforce as it relates to manufacturing. This course aimed to give undergraduate first-year engineering students a positive view of advanced manufacturing and its impact on society. Student evaluations and comments were positive and affirmed the learning objective of teaching manufacturing to the first-year engineering students. The flipped classroom approach was demonstrated to be ideal during the COVID-19 pandemic with limited capacity for in-person lectures and labs. The use of flipped classrooms allowed students to learn at their own pace, review and reinforce knowledge, have a closer interaction with instructors, and reduce the number of technical errors using simulation tools. This course with the support of flipped classroom pedagogy can be successfully implemented in the post-pandemic era, devoting the time of the class to answer questions, expand upon the class content and have a closer in-person interaction with students.",ar,2022-09-01,Manufacturing Letters,"Industrial Robots | Manufacturing | Social science | Technical communication, flipped classroom",2-s2.0-85138049616,S2213846322001493,,Article,Funes-Lora M.A.,60025778,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",Ann Arbor,United States,5,"Funes-Lora, Miguel A.;Fu, Albert Q.;Webster, Noah;Burcon, Sarah;Shih, Albert J.",57204394245;57203572528;57890999100;57190187894;57222610536,60025778;60025778;60025778;60025778;60025778,September 2022,22138463,21100283796,,Journal,33,,,970-981,1,,undefined,,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mfglet.2022.07.118

Many existing multi-robot path planning algorithms may no longer work properly in the narrow-lane environment. We propose in this paper a dual-layer algorithm to deal with the multi-robot path planning problem in the narrow-lane environment. In the first layer, the integer programming technique primarily based on distance metrics balances the optimality of the generated collision-free paths and the computation time of the algorithm. In the second layer, fast feasible heuristics are applied to make sure the solvability of the proposed integer programming approach in the first layer. In the dual-layer algorithm, specific traffic policies for each narrow lane are implemented to generate a collision-free path for every robot while maintaining the narrow lane free, besides the collision avoidance approach at the robotic level. With this, inter-robot collision in the narrow lane is avoided, and the algorithm’s efficiency in producing collision-free paths increases. Simulations have been launched considerably based on the proposed assessment metrics. According to the extensive simulation data, our algorithm suggests a higher overall performance in the narrow-lane environment when in contrast with the present optimal, sub-optimal, and polynomial-complexity algorithms.",ar,2022-09-01,Intelligent Service Robotics,Industrial automation | Moving robots | Multi robot systems | Optimization algorithms | Path planning,2-s2.0-85135518308,,,Article,Huo J.,60117978;60117834;60018308,"State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology;College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University;Xi'an Jiaotong University",Hangzhou;Hangzhou;Xi'an,China;China;China,4,"Huo, Jiaxi;Zheng, Ronghao;Zhang, Senlin;Liu, Meiqin",57226604178;35106314700;57189218610;26643265600,60117834-60117978;60117834-60117978;60117834-60117978;60117834-60117978-60018308,September 2022,18612776,9500154152,18612784,Journal,15,4,,537-555,0,"NNSFC, NNSF, NSF, NSFC",2021XZZX014,National Natural Science Foundation of China-Zhejiang Joint Fund for the Integration of Industrialization and Informatization,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11370-022-00436-4

With the rise of automatic programming systems, programmers are no longer required to have a thorough understanding of the code. As a result of the interaction between the robot and the human, automatic programming systems generate a robot program. Many processing and recognition technologies for human-computer interaction interface are required to make the robot realize a more natural interaction. It is necessary to consider disruptive technologies in order to provide innovation and enable us to change the way we program. In this paper, we proposed approach to do automatic programming for industrial robots with natural language. To begin, we use a multi-attention mechanism to measure the matching probability of natural language instructions to objects in the environment. Then, using a modular programming method, we generate code for robots and combine the prediction results. We extend the existing dataset for evaluation to make it more suitable for describing the actual manufacturing environment, taking into account position, attribute, and constraints. The experimental results show that the model in this paper has a 20% higher recognition rate than other existing methods for accurately locating the object position, and the similarity between code written by experienced engineers and code generated by our more reached 80%.",ar,2022-09-01,Journal of Grid Computing,Deep learning | Industrial robot programming | Machine vision | Natural language,2-s2.0-85135302572,,,Article,Hu H.,60017536;60013614,Southern Methodist University;Hangzhou Dianzi University,Dallas;Hangzhou,United States;China,5,"Hu, Haiyang;Chen, Jie;Liu, Hanwen;Li, Zhongjin;Huang, Liguo",55561747600;57203334789;57828323400;57072282000;7404735614,60013614;60013614;60013614;60013614;60017536,September 2022,15707873,800147111,15729184,Journal,20,3,26,,0,NSFC,2018C01012,National Natural Science Foundation of China,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10723-022-09618-x

Firstly, the algorithm adds obstacle learning matrix to improve the success rate of path planning; and introduces heuristic reward to speed up the learning process by reducing the search space; then proposes a method of dynamically adjusting the exploration factor to balance the exploration and utilization in path planning, so as to further improve the performance of the algorithm. Finally, the simulation experiment in grid environment shows that compared with Q-learning algorithm, the improved algorithm not only shortens the average path length of the robot to reach the target position, but also speeds up the learning efficiency of the algorithm, so that the robot can find the optimal path more quickly.

The study aims to compare the effect of a structured versus an unstructured ER curriculum on students’ group metacognition during collaborative problem-solving with ER. The authors’ hypothesis is that an unstructured ER curriculum might be more beneficial in supporting young learners’ group metacognition in programming contexts. This study follows a quasi-experimental design with students (n = 35) split into two comparison groups – a structured ER curriculum group and an unstructured one. The results show that students in the structured curriculum group demonstrated higher levels of group metacognition and better collaboration.

10.1007/s13042-022-01544-4,A heuristically self-organised Linguistic Attribute Deep Learning for edge intelligence,"With the development of the internet of things (IoT), IoT intelligence is becoming a new technology. The “curse of dimensionality” is the barrier of data fusion in edge devices to the success of IoT intelligence. Deep Learning has attracted a lot of attention recently due to its successful application in various fields such as image processing and natural language processing. However, the success of Deep Learning benefits from the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computing. Similar to conventional Deep Learning, the computational complexity of optimising LAHs blocks the applications of LAHs. However, unlike conventional Deep Learning, an Linguistic Attribute Hierarchy (LAH) embedded with Linguistic Decision Trees (LDTs) could overcome the shortcoming of the lack of interpretation by providing transparent information propagation through the rules created by LDTs in the LAH. To address the challenge in the construction of high-performance LAHs, we propose a heuristic approach for constructing an LAH embedded with LDTs for decision making or classification by using the distance correlations between attributes and between attributes and the target variable. The set of attributes is divided into some attribute clusters and then heuristically organised into an LAH. The proposed approach has been validated on some benchmark decision or classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository. The experimental results show that the proposed self-organisation algorithm can create an effective and efficient LAH. Such a self-organised LAH embedded with LDTs can not only efficiently address “curse of dimensionality” in a single LDT for data fusion with massive attributes, but also achieve better or comparable performance in decision making or classification compared to a single LDT for the problem to be solved. The main contribution of this work is that (1) an LAH provides a new attribute Deep Learning approach with good transparency and extends the conventional Deep Learning, which usually denotes a black-box deep neural network; (2) the self-organisation algorithm for SOLAH is much more efficient than the genetic algorithm in the wrapper for optimising LAHs, and SOLAH can achieve comparable results to the LAH, which was optimised by the genetic algorithm in the wrapper (GAW). This is crucial for edge intelligence and makes it feasible to embed SOLAH and the self-organisation algorithm in edge devices for IoT applications. Hence, this research will take a step towards edge intelligence.",ar,2022-09-01,International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics,Distance correlation clustering | Edge intelligence | Lab semantics | Linguistic Attribute Hierarchy | Linguistic decision tree | Self-organisation,2-s2.0-85128752679,,,Article,He H.,60017098;124412274,De Montfort University;Smart Perception Ltd,Leicester;Milton Keynes,United Kingdom;United Kingdom,2,"He, Hongmei;Zhu, Zhenhuan",55214926700;19640813400,60017098;124412274,September 2022,18688071,19700177336,1868808X,Journal,13,9,,2559-2579,0,,undefined,,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13042-022-01544-4

Conventional sampling-based algorithms have gained tremendous success in the path planning field, but they usually take much time to find the optimal solution so that the planning quality (evaluated with time cost and path length) cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, based on Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) and the family of Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) schemes, we propose the GMR-RRT∗ algorithm to achieve fast path planning for mobile robots. The proposed GMR-RRT∗ consists of learning navigation behaviors from human demonstrations and planning a high-quality path for the robot. Using the GMR, the key features of human demonstrations are captured to form a probability density distribution of the human trajectory in the current environment. This distribution is further utilized to guide the RRT scheme's sampling process to generate a feasible path in the current environment quickly. We test the proposed GMR-RRT∗ in different environments, comparing it with three state-of-the-art sampling-based algorithms.

Environment assumptions are the expectations that a system or a component makes about its operational environment and are often specified in terms of conditions over the inputs of that system or component. In this article, we propose an approach to automatically infer environment assumptions for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Our approach improves the state-of-the-art in three different ways: First, we learn assumptions for complex CPS models involving signal and numeric variables; second, the learned assumptions include arithmetic expressions defined over multiple variables; third, we identify the trade-off between soundness and coverage of environment assumptions and demonstrate the flexibility of our approach in prioritizing either of these criteria. We evaluate our approach using a public domain benchmark of CPS models from Lockheed Martin and a component of a satellite control system from LuxSpace, a satellite system provider.

10.1016/j.neucom.2022.05.081,The operating system of the neuromorphic BrainScaleS-1 system,"BrainScaleS-1 is a wafer-scale mixed-signal accelerated neuromorphic system targeted for research in the fields of computational neuroscience and beyond-von-Neumann computing. Here we present the BrainScaleS Operating System (BrainScaleS OS): the software stack gives users the possibility to emulate networks described in the high-level network description language PyNN with minimal knowledge of the system, as well as expert usage facilitated by allowing access to the system at any depth of the stack. BrainScaleS OS has been used extensively in the commissioning and calibration of BrainScaleS-1 as well as in various neuromorphic experiments, e.g., rate-based deep learning, accelerated physical emulation of Bayesian inference, solving of SAT problems, and others. The tolerance to faults of individual components of the neuromorphic system is reflected in the mapping process based on information stored in an availability database. We evaluate the robustness and compensation mechanisms of the system and software stack. The software stack is designed with performance in mind, with its core implemented in C++ and most user-facing API wrapped automatically to Python. The implemented multi-FPGA orchestration allows for parallel configuration and synchronized experiments facilitating wafer-scale experiments. The initial configuration of a wafer-scale experiment with hundreds of neuromorphic ASICs is performed in a fraction of a minute.

10.3389/fnbot.2022.915150,Distributed Small-Step Path Planning and Detection Method for Post-earthquake Robot to Inspect and Evaluate Building Damage,"Post-earthquake robots can be used extensively to inspect and evaluate building damage for safety assessment. However, the surrounding environment and path for such robots are complex and unstable with unexpected obstacles. Thus, path planning for such robot is crucial to guarantee satisfactory inspection and evaluation while approaching the ideal position. To achieve this goal, we proposed a distributed small-step path planning method using modified reinforcement learning (MRL). Limited distance and 12 directions were gridly refined for the robot to move around. The small moving step ensures the path planning to be optimal in a neighboring safe region. The MRL updates the direction and adjusts the path to avoid unknown disturbances. After finding the best inspection angle, the camera on the robot can capture the picture clearly, thereby improving the detection capability. Furthermore, the corner point detection method of buildings was improved using the Harris algorithm to enhance the detection accuracy. An experimental simulation platform was established to verify the designed robot, path planning method, and overall detection performance. Based on the proposed evaluation index, the post-earthquake building damage was inspected with high accuracy of up to 98%, i.e., 20% higher than traditional unplanned detection. The proposed robot can be used to explore unknown environments, especially in hazardous conditions unsuitable for humans.",ar,2022-08-15,Frontiers in Neurorobotics,building damage | building inspection | detection performance | inspection robot | shooting angle,2-s2.0-85136970392,,,Article,Tang Z.,60021182;111455316,Sun Yat-Sen University;Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Fire Science and Technology,Guangzhou;Guangzhou,China;China,5,"Tang, Zhaojia;Wang, Ping;Wang, Yong;Wang, Changgeng;Han, Yu",57545073600;56732129500;57766955600;57867174100;57220116063,60021182-111455316;60021182-111455316;60021182-111455316;60021182-111455316;60021182-111455316,15 August 2022,,21100199837,16625218,Journal,16,,915150,,1,NKRDPC,2021YFC3001000,National Key Research and Development Program of China,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbot.2022.915150

10.3390/s22155910,CLSQL: Improved Q-Learning Algorithm Based on Continuous Local Search Policy for Mobile Robot Path Planning,"How to generate the path planning of mobile robots quickly is a problem in the field of robotics. The Q-learning(QL) algorithm has recently become increasingly used in the field of mobile robot path planning. However, its selection policy is blind in most cases in the early search process, which slows down the convergence of optimal solutions, especially in a complex environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a continuous local search Q-Learning (CLSQL) algorithm to solve these problems and ensure the quality of the planned path. First, the global environment is gradually divided into independent local environments. Then, the intermediate points are searched in each local environment with prior knowledge. After that, the search between each intermediate point is realized to reach the destination point. At last, by comparing other RL-based algorithms, the proposed method improves the convergence speed and computation time while ensuring the optimal path.",ar,2022-08-01,Sensors,complex environment | mobile robot | path planning | prior knowledge | Q-learning,2-s2.0-85136342354,,35957467,Article,Ma T.,60030867,Xi'an University of Science and Technology,Xi'an,China,7,"Ma, Tian;Lyu, Jiahao;Yang, Jiayi;Xi, Runtao;Li, Yuancheng;An, Jinpeng;Li, Chao",55490554800;57326617800;57194166958;57222897865;35753300300;57826397700;57853677000,60030867;60030867;60030867;60030867;60030867;60030867;60030867,August 2022,14248220,130124,,Journal,22,15,5910,,1,NSFC,IPBED11,National Natural Science Foundation of China,3,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22155910

The traditional global path planning methods have some shortcomings, such as difficulty in digging into environmental information and finding the optimal path effectively. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a negative gradient differential biogeography-based optimization (NG-DBBO), which has strong local search ability and global optimization ability. Firstly, we present a differential migration approach to increase the population diversity in the iterative process of NG-DBBO, which can realize the information sharing between feature solutions effectively. Then a negative gradient descent strategy based on negative gradient descent is introduced to improve the learning rate, which not only enhances initial global search ability, but also avoids premature convergence. Noteworthily, the convergence of the algorithm is analyzed for single-peak and multi-peak problems respectively. After that, NG-DBBO is combined with the cubic spline interpolation to realize MRPP by the defined coding method and fitness function. The simulation experiments are used to demonstrate the availability of our method, which consist of two parts. In the first part, we select 23 benchmark functions to verify the accuracy and convergence speed of the NG-DBBO algorithm.

10.1007/s10015-022-00769-4,Biomorphic robot controls: event driven model free deep SNNs for complex visuomotor tasks,"The human brain surpass conventional computer architectures in regard to energy efficiency, robustness, connectivity and adaptivity. These aspects are inspiring today’s emerging biomorphic technologies into both directions, software tools, and hardware systems. Thus, it is worthwhile to investigate into biological processes which enable the brain to perform computations and how they can be modelled and implemented in silicon. Taking inspiration from how the brain performs information processing requires a shift of computational paradigms compared to conventional computer architectures. Indeed, the brain is composed of nervous cells, called neurons, connected with synapses and forming self-organized networks. Neurons and synapses are complex dynamical systems ruled by biochemical and electrical reactions. As a result, they rely on local information forming functional neural clusters. Additionally, neurons communicate with each other with short electrical pulses, called spikes, which travel across synapses. Computational neuroscientists and roboticists attempt to model these computations with spiking neural networks (SNNs) and to ground them with real robots. When implemented on dedicated neuromorphic hardware, spiking neural networks can perform time delay free, energy efficient computations in analogy to the brain. Until recently, the advantages of this technology were limited due to the lack of efficient methods for programming spiking neural networks. Reinforcement learning is one paradigm for programming spiking neural networks, in which neural clusters self-organize them towards functional networks.

Learning from demonstrations is a highly effective paradigm for robotic learning, where a robot learns from human actions directly and can be used autonomously for new tasks, avoiding the complicated analytical calculation for motion programming. However, the learned skills are not easy to generalize to new cases where special constraints such as varying relative distance limitation of robotic end effectors for human-like cooperative manipulations exist. In this paper, we propose a dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) based skills learning framework for redundant dual-arm robots. The method, with a coupling acceleration term to the DMPs function, is inspired by the transient performance control of Barrier Lyapunov Functions. The additional coupling acceleration term is calculated based on the constant joint distance and varying relative distance limitations of end effectors for object-approaching actions. In addition, we integrate the generated actions in joint space and the solution for a redundant dual-arm robot to complete a human-like manipulation.

Furthermore, even for just one complex environment, a single set of fine-tuned parameters may not work well in different regions of that environment. These problems prohibit reliable mobile robot deployment by non-expert users. As a remedy, we propose Adaptive Planner Parameter Learning (APPL), a machine learning framework that can leverage non-expert human interaction via several modalities – including teleoperated demonstrations, corrective interventions, and evaluative feedback – and also unsupervised reinforcement learning to learn a parameter policy that can dynamically adjust the parameters of classical navigation systems in response to changes in the environment. APPL inherits safety and explainability from classical navigation systems while also enjoying the benefits of machine learning, i.e., the ability to adapt and improve from experience.

To control these devices in an environment shared with human operators require state of the art computer perception and motion planning algorithms to be used as part of the automation system. This new type of intelligent automation system, where intelligent machines and learning algorithms are replacing more traditional automation solutions, requires new methods and workflows to keep up with the increase in complexity. This paper presents an interactive and iterative framework for solving some of these new challenges.

Background: Human-robot interaction (HRI) is affected by the actual but also expected robot's appearance and capabilities. Multiple factors, such as age, gender, media exposure, ICT exposure, or culture, influence mental models regarding robots; therefore, it is important to investigate those for a specific cohort in the designated geographical area. Research Questions: The mental models regarding robots and programming, and the way they are possibly biased by popular culture, exposure to ICT or parental influence were studied. Research questions concerned cognitive elements of mental models, namely, definitions and knowledge of robots, and programming and how those progress in time. Also, the research studied a figurative aspect of mental models regarding robots, with a focus on anthropomorphic features. Methodology: To research the influence of the short-term HRI, four classes of eight to nine years old elementary school pupils were included in a workshop where pre and postquestionnaires were used as research instruments. Besides pupils, later in this two-phase longitudinal research, after a year of formal education in Informatics, research instruments also included teachers and parents, to investigate their influence on children's mental models. Findings: The change of mental models under the influence of the one-time workshop was not permanent. However, a combination of maturation with informal and formal intervention supports the conceptualization of programming.",ar,2022-08-01,IEEE Transactions on Education,Computer science education | educational robots | educational technology | formal and informal learning | human-computer interaction (HCI) | ICT platform | programming | robots | STEM | technology-assisted learning,2-s2.0-85127060451,,,Article,Storjak I.,60159855,"University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing",Zagreb,Croatia,3,"Storjak, Ivana;Krzic, Ana Sovic;Jagust, Tomislav",57221233545;57539321000;36508666700,60159855;60159855;60159855,1 August 2022,00189359,17344,15579638,Journal,65,3,,297-308,0,,undefined,,3,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.2022.3158472

We formulate the scheduling and path planning problems for the UAV. The goal of the scheduling problem is to find the sequence of nodes that the UAV will visit to complete the data collection task in the shortest possible time, ensuring that it does not run out of energy during its mission. We express this problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem and propose an efficient algorithm to solve the aforementioned NP-hard problem in polynomial time. Path planning problem aims to find a collision-free path for the UAV. While the state-of-the-art schemes have focused on solving the path planning problem in static environments, we study the problem in a dynamic environment with moving obstacles. We develop an algorithm that works on both static and dynamic environments. Our method combines deep reinforcement learning (RL) with graph-based global path planning algorithms to find a collision-free path for the UAV. One important advantage of our RL-based method over the existing studies is its map independency, which allows us to transform the agent's learning from one environment to another.

However, existing works in both industry and academia mainly focus on the adaptive robot planning, while seldom consider human operator's intentions in advance. Hence, it hinders the HRCA transition toward a proactive manner. To overcome the bottleneck, this article proposes a multimodal transfer-learning-enabled action prediction approach, serving as the prerequisite to ensure the proactive HRCA. First, a multimodal intelligence-based action recognition approach is proposed to predict ongoing human actions by leveraging the visual stream and skeleton stream with short-time input frames. Second, a transfer-learning-enabled model is adapted to transfer learnt knowledge from daily activities to industrial assembly operations rapidly for online operator intention analysis. Third, a dynamic decision-making mechanism, including robotic decision and motion control, is described to allow mobile robots to assist operators in a proactive manner. Finally, an aircraft bracket assembly task is demonstrated in the laboratory environment, and the comparative study result shows that the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art ones for efficient action prediction.",ar,2022-08-01,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,Action recognition | human-robot collaboration | multimodal intelligence | transfer learning,2-s2.0-85114652119,,,Article,Li S.,60008928;60002014,The Hong Kong Polytechnic University;The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),Hong Kong;Stockholm,Hong Kong;Sweden,4,"Li, Shufei;Zheng, Pai;Fan, Junming;Wang, Lihui",57210917473;56352424300;57252702200;55080150600,60008928;60008928;60008928;60002014,1 August 2022,02780046,26053,15579948,Journal,69,8,,8579-8588,0,,undefined,,36,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2021.3105977
10.1109/TEVC.2021.3106672,Genetic Programming for Manifold Learning: Preserving Local Topology,"Manifold learning (MaL) methods are an invaluable tool in today's world of increasingly huge datasets. MaL algorithms can discover a much lower-dimensional representation (embedding) of a high-dimensional dataset through nonlinear transformations that preserve the most important structure of the original data. State-of-the-art MaL methods directly optimize an embedding without mapping between the original space and the discovered embedded space. This makes interpretability - a key requirement in exploratory data analysis - nearly impossible. Recently, genetic programming has emerged as a very promising approach to MaL by evolving functional mappings from the original space to an embedding. However, genetic programming-based MaL has struggled to match the performance of other approaches. In this work, we propose a new approach to using genetic programming for MaL, which preserves local topology. This is expected to significantly improve performance on tasks where local neighborhood structure (topology) is paramount. We compare our proposed approach with various baseline MaL methods and find that it often outperforms other methods, including a clear improvement over previous genetic programming approaches. These results are particularly promising, given the potential interpretability and reusability of the evolved mappings.",ar,2022-08-01,IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation,Evolutionary learning | feature construction | feature selection | genetic programming (GP) | manifold learning (MaL),2-s2.0-85113864073,,,Article,Lensen A.,60002316,Victoria University of Wellington,Wellington,New Zealand,3,"Lensen, Andrew;Xue, Bing;Zhang, Mengjie",57188680921;55329093700;8729040400,60002316;60002316;60002316,1 August 2022,1089778X,25037,19410026,Journal,26,4,,661-675,0,,VUW1913,,3,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2021.3106672

Enhancing 21st century skills through educational robotics,"Recent technological advances require new learning and teaching methods and a reform of traditional school curricula to promote STEM and 21st-century skills. Educational robotics is considered a powerful tool, not only to learn programing, but also to enhance soft and transversal skills, such as problem-solving, metacognition, divergent thinking, creativity, and collaboration. This contribution presents a one-year research project aimed at integrating maker education and educational robotics into the primary and lower secondary school curriculum. The project is developed through a multidisciplinary and longitudinal approach and adopts the Design-Based Implementation Research methodology. It involved 50 fourth and fifth grade Italian students until the following school year. As an integrating background theme, we chose the 17 Goals outlined by the UN in the 2030 Agenda. Each selected goal was addressed by solving challenges in groups. Educational robotics became a tool for learning many concepts, such as renewable energies, human body systems or states of matter, but especially for working on creativity and ability to design, build, collaborate, and revise. We investigated students’ attitude toward STEM and 21st-century skills and their perceived school self-efficacy administrating two questionnaires pre and post the two parts of the project. This paper discusses findings on students’ attitude toward 21st-century skills. In the post analyzes of both Part 1 and 2, this field showed the highest scores compared to STEM fields. The pre-post data show an improvement in organizational, interpersonal, and leadership skills from Part 1, but also a gradual increase in personal and management skills.",ar,2022-07-25,Frontiers in Education,2030 agenda | 21st century skills | educational robotics | maker education | school curriculum,2-s2.0-85136792512,,,Article,Gratani F.,60027141,Università degli Studi di Macerata,Macerata,Italy,2,"Gratani, Francesca;Giannandrea, Lorella",57226274711;24775712800,60027141;60027141,25 July 2022,,21100935978,2504284X,Journal,7,,955285,,1,,undefined,,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2022.955285

The tools are kept in a central tool magazine (CTM), which is shared by and serves many machines. Tool transporter (TT) and AGVs shift tools and jobs among machines respectively. This concurrent scheduling problem is extremely complex in nature as it involves determining the lowest possible tool copies of every type of tool, allocation of AGVs and tools copies to job-operations, job-operations sequencing on machines, and associated trip operations including the dead heading trip and loaded trip times of AGVs. This paper proposes nonlinear mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation to model this problem and symbiotic organisms search algorithm (SOSA) for solving this problem. Verification is carried out using an industrial problem in a manufacturing firm. The results show that employing two copies for one tool type and one copy each for the remaining tool types results in no tool delay and reduction in MSN which causes a reduction in cost, and SOSA is providing better solution than Jaya algorithm.",ar,2022-07-10,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,AGVs | AGVs and tools scheduling | FMS | machines | optimization techniques | symbiotic organisms search algorithm | without tool delay,2-s2.0-85127549038,,,Article,Mareddy P.L.,60115098;60113938;60106974,"Satya Institute of Technology and Management;Annamacharya Institute of Technology &amp; Sciences, Rajampet;JNTUA College of Engineering, Ananthapuramu",Vizianagaram;Rajampet;Anantapur,India;India;India,4,"Mareddy, Padma Lalitha;Narapureddy, Sivarami Reddy;Dwivedula, Venkata Ramamurthy;Karanam, Prahlada Rao",57201835524;57200216386;57561356400;57226304161,60113938;60113938;60115098;60106974,10 July 2022,15320626,27871,15320634,Journal,34,15,e6950,,0,,undefined,,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.1002/cpe.6950

By analyzing and comparing the current research situation of digital twin technology in the field of coal mine, the framework of digital twin-driven tunneling robot decision control system is designed, including six modules:physical space, virtual space, twin data, planning layer, control layer and execution layer. In this system, the virtual prototype can make planning decisions autonomously and control the synchronous motion of the physical prototype remotely. Firstly, the local obstacle avoidance strategy in unstructured environment is studied based on virtual reality technology. Motion control model and sensor observation model of tunneling robot are established, and obstacles in roadway are reconstructed in virtual environment by laser radar, Ray-Col method is used to detect the collision between robot and obstacle, which lays the foundation for robot path planning decision. Secondly, the global path planning method based on virtual agent is studied by combining deep reinforcement learning technology, the Muti-PPO algorithm based on the improved PPO algorithm is proposed, and the virtual agent of tunneling robot is established through the reward and punishment mechanism, and training in Unity3D platform, The training results show that compared with PPO algorithm and SAC algorithm, the average reward value of Muti - PPO algorithm is increased by 13.82% and 11.31% respectively. Standard deviation decreased by 17.85% and 16.81% respectively; the maximum reward value is increased by 0.14% and 0.43% respectively, and its performance is optimal among the three algorithms. Finally, a decision control platform is built to send the decision instructions generated in the virtual space to the end-effector of the physical prototype, and drive the synchronous change of the virtual prototype through the sensor data of the physical prototype. According to the planning decision, bidirectional mapping and remote control functions of the system, path planning experiment and virtual-real co-movement experiment are designed to verify it. The experimental results of path planning show that the error between the end point of virtual agent path planning and the target point is within 1.2 cm under three different complexity conditions, and the control information can be transmitted to the physical space to control the robot motion remotely. The experimental results show that the virtual prototype and the physical prototype are consistent in the roadway during the operation of the tunneling robot.

This paper proposes a hierarchical path planning approach for a wheeled robot to move in a partially known uneven terrain. We first model the partially known uneven terrain environment respecting the terrain features, including the slope, step, and unevenness. Second, facilitated by the terrain model, we use A (Formula presented.) algorithm to plan a global path for the robot based on the partially known map. Finally, the Q-learning method is employed for local path planning to avoid locally detected obstacles in close range as well as impassable terrain areas when the robot tracks the global path. The simulation and experimental results show that the designed path planning approach provides satisfying paths that avoid locally detected obstacles and impassable areas in a partially known uneven terrain compared with the classical A (Formula presented.) algorithm and the artificial potential field method.",ar,2022-07-01,Sensors,A  algorithm ⋆ | hierarchical path planning | Q-learning algorithm | uneven terrain,2-s2.0-85135127118,,35890897,Article,Zhang B.,60000937,Shenzhen University,Shenzhen,China,6,"Zhang, Bo;Li, Guobin;Zheng, Qixin;Bai, Xiaoshan;Ding, Yu;Khan, Awais",57221979304;57823228900;57822865000;56447681400;57823469300;57226618544,60000937;60000937;60000937;60000937;60000937;60000937,July 2022,14248220,130124,,Journal,22,14,5217,,1,NSFC,62003217,National Natural Science Foundation of China,13,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22145217
10.1177/17298806221110022,A snake-inspired path planning algorithm based on reinforcement learning and self-motion for hyper-redundant manipulators,"Redundant manipulators are flexible enough to adapt to complex environments, but their controller is also required to be specific for their extra degrees of freedom. Inspired by the morphology of snakes, we propose a path planning algorithm named Swinging Search and Crawling Control, which allows the snake-like redundant manipulators to explore in complex pipeline environments without collision. The proposed algorithm consists of the Swinging Search and the Crawling Control. In Swinging Search, a collision-free manipulator configuration that of the end-effector in the target point is found by applying reinforcement learning to self-motion, instead of designing joint motion. The self-motion narrows the search space to the null space, and the reinforcement learning makes the algorithm use the information of the environment, instead of blindly searching. Then in Crawling Control, the manipulator is controlled to crawl to the target point like a snake along the collision-free configuration. It only needs to search for a collision-free configuration for the manipulator, instead of searching collision-free configurations throughout the process of path planning. Simulation experiments show that the algorithm can complete path planning tasks of hyper-redundant manipulators in complex environments. The 16 degrees of freedom and 24 degrees of freedom manipulators can achieve 83.3% and 96.7% success rates in the pipe, respectively. In the concentric pipe, the 24 degrees of freedom manipulator has a success rate of 96.1%.",ar,2022-07-01,International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems,Crawling Control | path planning | Redundant manipulator | reinforcement learning | self-motion | Swinging Search,2-s2.0-85134293687,,,Article,Lin Y.,60195520,Tiangong University,Tianjin,China,5,"Lin, Yue;Wang, Jianming;Xiao, Xuan;Qu, Ji;Qin, Fatao",57220023716;56448807900;57219627237;57312797300;57807287700,60195520;60195520;60195520;60195520;60195520,July 2022,17298806,144749,17298814,Journal,19,4,,,1,,19PTZWHZ00020,Tianjin Science and Technology Program,2,2022,https://doi.org/10.1177/17298806221110022

But collecting sufficient experience data for end-to-end learning is often infeasible in the real world, as deploying robots in many environments can be prohibitively expensive. On the other hand, large-scale scene understanding datasets contain diverse and rich semantic and geometric information. But how to leverage such information for manipulation remains an open problem.

10.1109/LRA.2022.3186508,Utilizing Hidden Observations to Enhance the Performance of the Trained Agent,"The frame-skipping strategy has been widely employed in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology to train an agent. Specifically, this strategy repeats the action determined by the agent for a fixed number of frames. It increases computational efficiency by reducing the number of inferences by making the action decision sparse. However, previously, these consecutive changes in frames during the frame-skipping were hidden and ignored from the environment and did not affect the agent's action decision. As a result, it can adversely affect the performance of trained agents, where the performance is more critical than computational efficiency. To alleviate these issues, we propose a new framework that utilizes these hidden frames during the frame-skipping, called $hidden$ $observation$, to enhance the performance of the trained agent. The proposed framework retrieves all hidden observations during frame skipping. It then combines batch inference and an exponentially weighted sum to calculate and merge the outputs from hidden observations. Through experiments, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of both performance and stability with only a marginal increase in computation.",ar,2022-07-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,AI-Enabled Robotics | Control Architectures and Programming | Reinforcement Learning | Robust/Adaptive Control,2-s2.0-85133765546,,,Article,Jang S.,60199632;60001558,Gachon University;Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute,Seongnam;Daejeon,South Korea;South Korea,2,"Jang, Sooyoung;Lee, Joohyung",57205304525;57823180800,60001558;60199632,1 July 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,3,,7858-7864,0,MSIP,2021R1F1A1048098,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning",0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3186508

10.1109/LRA.2022.3187833,Learning Pneumatic Non-Prehensile Manipulation with a Mobile Blower,"We investigate pneumatic non-prehensile manipulation (i.e., blowing) as a means of efficiently moving scattered objects into a target receptacle. Due to the chaotic nature of aerodynamic forces, a blowing controller must i) continually adapt to unexpected changes from its actions, ii) maintain fine-grained control, since the slightest misstep can result in large unintended consequences (e.g., scatter objects already in a pile), and iii) infer long-range plans (e.g., move the robot to strategic blowing locations). We tackle these challenges in the context of deep reinforcement learning, introducing a multi-frequency version of the spatial action maps framework. This allows for efficient learning of vision-based policies that effectively combine high-level planning and low-level closed-loop control for dynamic mobile manipulation. Experiments show that our system learns efficient behaviors for the task, demonstrating in particular that blowing achieves better downstream performance than pushing, and that our policies improve performance over baselines. Moreover, we show that our system naturally encourages emergent specialization between the different subpolicies spanning low-level fine-grained control and high-level planning.

10.1109/LRA.2022.3184787,Source Term Estimation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning With Gaussian Mixture Model Feature Extraction for Mobile Sensors,"This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning method for mobile sensors to estimate the properties of the source of the hazardous gas release. The problem of estimating the properties of the released gas is generally termed as the source term estimation (STE) problem. Since the sensor measurements from atmospheric gas dispersion are sparse, intermittent, and time-varying due to the turbulence and the sensor noise, STE is considered to be a challenging problem. The particle filter is adopted to estimate the source term under such stochastic noise conditions. The deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is also employed to find the best source search policy in terms of successful estimation and traveled distance. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that the use of the Gaussian mixture model, which clusters the potential source positions from the particle filter, as an input to the DDPG and the gated recurrent unit functioning as a memory in DDPG help to improve the STE performance. Besides, simulation results in randomized source term conditions and previously-unseen environments show the superior STE performance of the proposed algorithm compared with the existing information-theoretic STE algorithm.",ar,2022-07-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Autonomous agents | Machine learning for robot control | Motion and path planning | Reinforcement learning | Robotics in hazardous fields,2-s2.0-85133696018,,,Article,Park M.,60103153,Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology,Ulsan,South Korea,3,"Park, Minkyu;Ladosz, Pawel;Oh, Hyondong",57564981900;56419995100;25655230900,60103153;60103153;60103153,1 July 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,3,,8323-8330,0,MOE,2020R1A6A1A03040570,Ministry of Education,2,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3184787

In order to plan an efficient path that allows the vehicle to be autonomously navigated in cluttered environments, the path planning problem is solved as a multi-objective optimization problem. First, the vehicle perception is fully achieved by means of inertial measurement unit (IMU), wheels odometry, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR). In order to compensate the sensors drift to achieve more reliable data and improve the localization estimation and corrections, data fusion between the outputs of wheels odometry, LiDAR, and IMU is made through extended Kalman filter (EKF). Then, TLBO is proposed and applied to determine the optimum online path, where the objectives are to find the shortest path to reach the target destination, and to maximize the path smoothness, while avoiding the surrounding obstacles, and taking into account the vehicle dynamic and algebraic constraints. To check the performance of the proposed TLBO algorithm, it is compared in simulation to genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and a hybrid GA–PSO algorithm. Finally, real-time experiments based on robot operating system (ROS) implementation are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed path planning algorithm.",ar,2022-07-01,Intelligent Service Robotics,Autonomous tracked vehicles | Path planning | Teaching–learning-based optimization (TLBO),2-s2.0-85132837165,,,Article,Sabiha A.D.,60032320;117925388,Military Technical College;Egyptian Academy for Engineering and Advanced Technology,Cairo;Cairo,Egypt;Egypt,4,"Sabiha, Ahmed D.;Kamel, Mohamed A.;Said, Ehab;Hussein, Wessam M.",57219267254;56747285200;57216394031;56313559200,60032320;60032320;60032320;117925388,July 2022,18612776,9500154152,18612784,Journal,15,3,,381-398,1,,undefined,,4,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11370-022-00429-3
10.1109/LRA.2022.3181755,Learning Minimum-Time Flight in Cluttered Environments,"We tackle the problem of minimum-time flight for a quadrotor through a sequence of waypoints in the presence of obstacles while exploiting the full quadrotor dynamics. Early works relied on simplified dynamics or polynomial trajectory representations that did not exploit the full actuator potential of the quadrotor, and, thus, resulted in suboptimal solutions. Recent works can plan minimum-time trajectories; yet, the trajectories are executed with control methods that do not account for obstacles. Thus, a successful execution of such trajectories is prone to errors due to model mismatch and in-flight disturbances. To this end, we leverage deep reinforcement learning and classical topological path planning to train robust neural-network controllers for minimum-time quadrotor flight in cluttered environments. The resulting neural network controller demonstrates substantially better performance of up to 19% over state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the learned policy solves the planning and control problem simultaneously online to account for disturbances, thus achieving much higher robustness. As such, the presented method achieves 100% success rate of flying minimum-time policies without collision, while traditional planning and control approaches achieve only 40%. The proposed method is validated in both simulation and the real world, with quadrotor speeds of up to 42\h-1 and accelerations of 3.6 g.",ar,2022-07-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Integrated planning and learning | motion and path planning | reinforcement learning,2-s2.0-85132692404,,,Article,Penicka R.,60012614,Universität Zürich,Zurich,Switzerland,4,"Penicka, Robert;Song, Yunlong;Kaufmann, Elia;Scaramuzza, Davide",57191846693;57221161101;57200625254;16550950000,60012614;60012614;60012614;60012614,1 July 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,3,,7209-7216,0,SNF,51NF40-185543,Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung,9,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3181755

This task is challenging because it requires the robot to integrate the semantics of the unconstrained natural language instructions with the robot's egocentric visual observations of the environment which are typically incomplete and noisy. To address these challenges, we propose a method that is able to use visible landmarks to more efficiently explore the environment in search of the objects described by the natural language instructions. Additionally, we propose using a pose adjustment policy during manipulation planning to help the robot recover from noisy visual observations. We show that this policy can be trained through experience with reinforcement learning as well as with human-in-the-loop feedback.

10.1109/LRA.2022.3178810,Image-Goal Navigation in Complex Environments via Modular Learning,"We present a novel approach for image-goal navigation, where an agent navigates with a goal image rather than accurate target information, which is more challenging. Our goal is to decouple the learning of navigation goal planning, collision avoidance, and navigation ending prediction, which enables more concentrated learning of each part. This is realized by four different modules. The first module maintains an obstacle map during robot navigation. The second predicts a long-term goal on the real-time map periodically, which can thus convert an image-goal navigation task to several point-goal navigation tasks. To achieve these point-goal navigation tasks, the third module plans collision-free command sets for navigating to these long-term goals. The final module stops the robot properly near the goal image. The four modules are designed or maintained separately, which helps cut down the search time during navigation and improve the generalization to previously unseen real scenes. We evaluate the method in both a simulator and in the real world with a mobile robot. The results in real complex environments show that our method attains at least a 17% increase in navigation success rate and a 23% decrease in navigation collision rate over some state-of-the-art models.",ar,2022-07-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Modular learning | motion and path planning | reactive and sensor-based planning | vision-based navigation,2-s2.0-85131717459,,,Article,Wu Q.,60021666;60020304;60001455,"Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics;University of Maryland, College Park;Anhui University",Nanjing;College Park;Hefei,China;United States;China,5,"Wu, Qiaoyun;Wang, Jun;Liang, Jing;Gong, Xiaoxi;Manocha, Dinesh",57195407528;55878876500;57219439078;57208545781;35452853100,60001455;60021666;60020304;60021666;60020304,1 July 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,3,,6902-6909,0,NKRDPC,BK20190016,Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3178810

Despite the centrality of simulation in modern robotics, little work has been done comparing robotics simulators against real-world data, especially for scenarios involving dynamic motions with high speed impact events. Handling dynamic contact is the computational bottleneck for most simulations, and thus the modeling and algorithmic choices surrounding impacts and friction form the largest distinctions between popular tools. Here, we evaluate the ability of several simulators to reproduce real-world trajectories involving impacts. Using experimental data, we identify system-specific contact parameters of popular simulators Drake, MuJoCo, and Bullet, analyzing the effects of modeling choices around these parameters. For the simple example of a cube tossed onto a table, simulators capture inelastic impacts surprisingly well, though generally fail to reproduce elasticity.

10.11999/JEIT210412,Software Source Code Vulnerability Detection Based on CNN-GAP Interpretability Model,"Source code vulnerability detection is an important method to ensure the security of software system. In recent years, a variety of deep learning models are applied to source code vulnerability detection, which improves greatly the efficiency of vulnerability detection. However, there are still some problems in source code vulnerability detection based on deep learning, such as too many words outside the database caused by user-defined identifier, inaccurate semantics of embedded word vector, lack of interpretability of neural network model, and so on. A new software source code vulnerability detection method is proposed based on Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Global Average Pooling (GAP) interpretability model. Firstly, some user-defined identifiers are normalized in the source code preprocessing, and one hot coding is used for word embedding to alleviate the problem of too many words outside the database. Then, CNN-GAP neural network model is built to identify the functions containing CWE-119 type vulnerabilities. Finally, Class Activation Mapping (CAM) interpretable method is used to output visually the results and identify the codes that may be related to vulnerabilities. Compared with the model proposed by Russell and Vuldeepecker model proposed by Li et al., the experimental results show that CNN-GAP model can achieve quite or even better performance, and has a certain interpretability, which is convenient for researchers to analyze the vulnerability more deeply.",ar,2022-07-01,Dianzi Yu Xinxi Xuebao/Journal of Electronics and Information Technology,Deep learning | Interpretability of neural network | Source code vulnerability detection,2-s2.0-85130817697,,,Article,Wang J.,60024350,National University of Defense Technology China,Changsha,China,4,"Wang, Jian;Kuang, Hongyu;Li, Ruilin;Su, Yunfei",57211091103;55574640500;55491311800;57219573124,60024350;60024350;60024350;60024350,July 2022,10095896,24290,,Journal,44,7,,2568-2575,0,NSFC,61702540,National Natural Science Foundation of China,3,2022,https://doi.org/10.11999/JEIT210412
10.13225/j.cnki.jccs.2021.1130,Key technologies of coal mine robots for environment perception and path planning,"Coal production is a typical high-risk and hard work. Existing coal mine equipment requires skilled workers to directly or indirectly participate, which has high security risks and costs. Considering safety and efficiency of the industry, using robots in coal production instead of workers is an inevitable way for coal mining companies to achieve ""fewer-people"" or even ""unmanned"" production. It is also in line with the basic goal of ""digital mines"". In the autonomous operation of coal mine robots, environmental perception technology, which would realize robots' safety status assessment and provide basic data for decision-making and planning, is used to obtain workspace information. Moreover, path planning is the basis for robot movement and a key technology connecting environment perception and underlying control. The working principle, functional requirements, task objectives and environmental complexity of 5 types of coal mine robots (i.e. roadheader robots, shearer robots, transport robots, inspection robots and rescue robots) are summarized in this paper. We organize and analyse the important research of coal mine robots focusing on the environment perception and pafh planning in the past 15 years. Finally, the future development direction of key technologies of coal mine robots is prospected from 3 aspects; perception and cognition, planning and decision and system integration. The development trend of perception and cognition not only requires coal mine robots to have perception capabilities, but also requires robots to complete cognitive learning based on a small amount of available information outside of regular events. The key challenge is to develop multi-sensor fusion technology and few-shot learning methods. The development direction of planning and decision can be divided into single-target planning and multi-target decision-making. Coal mine robots use perception and cognitive information to achieve point-to-point path planning and obstacle avoidance, and complete multi-task optimization according to work requirements. Thereby, the working efficiency of coal mine robots can be improved. The development of robot collaboration systems and communication interactive systems is the main challenge for system integration.

10.1109/TCYB.2020.2981480,Bioinspired Scene Classification by Deep Active Learning with Remote Sensing Applications,"Accurately classifying sceneries with different spatial configurations is an indispensable technique in computer vision and intelligent systems, for example, scene parsing, robot motion planning, and autonomous driving. Remarkable performance has been achieved by the deep recognition models in the past decade. As far as we know, however, these deep architectures are incapable of explicitly encoding the human visual perception, that is, the sequence of gaze movements and the subsequent cognitive processes. In this article, a biologically inspired deep model is proposed for scene classification, where the human gaze behaviors are robustly discovered and represented by a unified deep active learning (UDAL) framework. More specifically, to characterize objects' components with varied sizes, an objectness measure is employed to decompose each scenery into a set of semantically aware object patches. To represent each region at a low level, a local-global feature fusion scheme is developed which optimally integrates multimodal features by automatically calculating each feature's weight. To mimic the human visual perception of various sceneries, we develop the UDAL that hierarchically represents the human gaze behavior by recognizing semantically important regions within the scenery. Importantly, UDAL combines the semantically salient region detection and the deep gaze shifting path (GSP) representation learning into a principled framework, where only the partial semantic tags are required. Meanwhile, by incorporating the sparsity penalty, the contaminated/redundant low-level regional features can be intelligently avoided. Finally, the learned deep GSP features from the entire scene images are integrated to form an image kernel machine, which is subsequently fed into a kernel SVM to classify different sceneries. Experimental evaluations on six well-known scenery sets (including remote sensing images) have shown the competitiveness of our approach.",ar,2022-07-01,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,Active learning | bioinspired | contaminated | gaze behavior | machine learning | multimodal | remote sensing,2-s2.0-85101805922,,33635802,Article,Zhang L.,60218018;60020224;60003970;128382446,Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence;Wenzhou University;Zhejiang University;Jinhua Polytechnic,Masdar City;Wenzhou;Hangzhou;Jinhua,United Arab Emirates;China;China;China,7,"Zhang, Luming;Su, Ge;Yin, Jianwei;Li, Ying;Lin, Qiuru;Zhang, Xiaoqin;Shao, Ling",35231925400;57650408700;8249720800;55945677900;57220176427;35232030000;55643855000,60020224-128382446;60003970;60003970;60003970;60003970;60020224;60218018,1 July 2022,21682267,21100274221,21682275,Journal,52,7,,5682-5694,0,,undefined,,3,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2020.2981480

We plan and optimize a CASP-proposed and human-refined multistep synthesis route toward an exemplary small molecule, sonidegib, on a modular, robotic flow synthesis platform with integrated process analytical technology (PAT) for data-rich experimentation. Human insights address catalyst deactivation and improve yield by strategic choices of order of addition. Multi-objective Bayesian optimization identifies optimal values for categorical and continuous process variables in the multistep route involving 3 reactions (including heterogeneous hydrogenation) and 1 separation. The platform's modularity, robotic reconfigurability, and flexibility for convergent synthesis are shown to be essential for allowing variation of downstream residence time in multistep flow processes and controlling the order of addition to minimize undesired reactivity.

10.3389/fpsyg.2022.904761,Educational Robotics Intervention to Foster Computational Thinking in Preschoolers: Effects of Children’s Task Engagement,"Computational thinking (CT) is a broadly used term in education to refer to the cognitive processes underlying the application of computer science concepts and strategies of problem-solving. Recent literature has pointed out the value of children acquiring computational thinking skills (i.e., understanding and applying concepts, such as conditionals, iteration, or generalization), especially while learning STEM subjects. Robotics has been used as a tool to introduce computational thinking and STEM knowledge to children. As physical objects, robots have been proposed as developmentally appropriate for the early childhood setting, promoting motivation and allowing young learners to represent abstract ideas in a concrete setting. This study presents a novel educational robotics (ER) intervention using RoboTito, a robot programmable through tangible elements in its environment designed for kindergarteners. We used a quasi-experimental design with an active control group. In addition, we conducted a structured observation of the filmed material of the sessions to gather data on children’s attention and motivation throughout the activities. Fifty-one children (male = 33; mean age = 66 months, SD = 5.49 months) attending level 5 (kindergarten) at a Uruguayan public school participated in the study. Children in our experimental condition participated in an intervention programming RoboTito using tangible elements, while children in our control condition played with the robot through sensory-motor activities using a remote control and did not engage in programming. Motivational and attentional factors were assessed through video-recorded sessions of the ER activities. Four trained observers blind to the experimental conditions participated in the coding. Children’s interactions were assessed in four categories: task engagement, distractibility, oral participation, and objective fulfillment. Our results suggest children’s task engagement mediated their gains in CT after the intervention; post-hoc Tukey contrasts revealed non-significant pre-test to post-test gains for the control and low engagement groups, and significant for the high engagement group. Overall, we conclude task engagement played a central role in children’s learning gains and our robotics intervention was successful in promoting CT for engaged children. We discuss the practical implications of our results for early childhood education and developmentally appropriate ER targeted for young learners.",ar,2022-06-21,Frontiers in Psychology,cognitive development | computational thinking | early childhood | preschool | robotics | task engagement,2-s2.0-85133711016,,,Article,Gerosa A.,60071612,Universidad de la Republica,Montevideo,Uruguay,5,"Gerosa, Anaclara;Koleszar, Víctor;Tejera, Gonzalo;Gómez-Sena, Leonel;Carboni, Alejandra",57215550263;57210600089;13907469600;57222997973;57205914805,60071612;60071612;60071612;60071612;60071612,21 June 2022,,21100216571,16641078,Journal,13,,904761,,1,ANII,FSED_2_2017_1_138793,Agencia Nacional de Investigación e Innovación,3,2022,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.904761
10.1108/IJILT-09-2021-0149,ICT teachers’ adaptations to online instruction during Covid-19 pandemic,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to reveal both the adaptations of information computer technology (ICT) teachers teaching the information technologies and software (ITS) course online during the pandemic and the factors that affect this adaptation process. Teachers’ endeavours to conduct their courses online, the support they take during their endeavours, and their relationships with such basic components as the environment, content and students during this adaptation process will be revealed within the framework of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a sequential transformative mixed model was used in which firstly quantitative and then qualitative data were collected and analysed. The sample of this study consists of 307 ICT teachers employed and serving at public and private school in 2020–21. A proper sampling technique is used in the study. In this study, a sequential transformative mixed model was used in which firstly quantitative and then qualitative data were collected and analysed (Creswell, 2009). The sample of this study consists of 307 ICT teachers employed and serving at public and private school in 2020–21. A proper sampling technique is used in the study. Findings: The ICT teachers’ adaptations to the online courses have developed positively over the sub-dimensions of UTAUT, which are performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SE), facilitating conditions (FC) and behavioural intention (BI). The ICT teachers’ adaptations to the online instruction process have a significant effect on PE, FC and BI on the basis of gender, and on PE and EE on the basis of course content quality. In the process whereby the ICT teachers carry out the ITS course online, the sub-dimensions of PE, SE and FC are significantly predictive of the BI. Research limitations/implications: UTAUT has been taken as a guiding framework in explaining and discussing the adaptations. Similarly, in other studies focussing on adaptation, this model could be employed in planning the research process. In addition, this study has followed a method in which qualitative data are mostly used to explain the quantitative data. Further studies may adopt a process whereby qualitative data are largely used to describe the way ITS course is conducted in online environments and this process may be used to develop a model. Practical implications: Examining the students’ BIs in online courses overlaps with the sub-dimension of PE in this study, which stresses that PE, EE and motivation are significantly and directly effective on the students’ intentions of using the online courses, while there is a difference between these two studies in terms of the dimension of EE. The factors such learning outcome, curriculum, attendance to the course, use of materials and tools, interaction and technological substructure appear to be affected by this dimension, so they could be taken as important in that they reveal the importance of the study. Originality/value: This study may provide clues for the online instruction practices that it reveals teachers’ adaptations to online learning environments at secondary schools. On the other hand, software, hardware, coding and robotics take place in the subjects like product designing, developing and programming that are within the content of ITS course for secondary schools. Even though there is a curriculum prepared for these subjects, a lot of different instruction techniques can be used for the teaching of these subjects. This can allow some inferences about the environments and methods suitable for the online instruction of the related subjects.",ar,2022-06-21,International Journal of Information and Learning Technology,ICT teachers | Information technologies and software course | Online instruction | Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology,2-s2.0-85129609673,,,Article,Sucu F.,60193844;60193841,Trabzon University;Ankara Hacı Bayram Veli University,Trabzon;Ankara,Turkey;Turkey,2,"Sucu, Fadime;Çakiroğlu, Ünal",57670295700;26656621800,60193841;60193844,21 June 2022,20564880,21100398003,20564899,Journal,39,3,,209-226,0,,undefined,,2,2022,https://doi.org/10.1108/IJILT-09-2021-0149
10.3901/JME.2022.11.072,Smoothed-shortcut Q-Learning Algorithm for Optimal Robot Agent Path Planning,"Quality path planning for a mobile robot in operation is the key to completing the task safely, efficiently and smoothly. Such a path planning often needs to be done base only on a given environment that is unknown to the Agent at the beginning, and an effective reinforcement learning is required. Smoothed-shortcut Q-learning (SSQL) Algorithm is presented that enable the Agent to learn and then figure out a smoothed short-cut path to the final goal that is initially unknown to the Agent in a given environment. The SSQL is proposed to solve practical problems for mobile robots effectively arrive at its goal in a strange environment, with a path that is a smooth and continuous curve of shortest distance. The SSQL algorithm consists three major ingredients. First, a virtual rectangular environment boundary of the environment is constructed, based on the pre-explored information. The Q values of guidance point for the virtual rectangular environment are increased to improve the learning efficiency of the Agent. Second, the path found by the Agent at the current time is then optimized by finding short-cuts along the path to eliminate the possible redundant paths and reduce the zig-zag segments, minimizing the total distance between the starting and target point. Third, at the turning positions on the path, the Bezier curve is used to further smooth the path, so as to improve the dynamics for the movement of the robot agent. The final path generated by our SSQL algorithm will be optimal in terms of fast convergence, smoothness and shortest distance. The SSQL algorithm is tested by comparison with the standard Q-Learning algorithm in different environments with various obstacle densities and learning rate. The results show that our SSQL algorithm has indeed achieved fast convergence, short and smooth paths, and with few turning points.",ar,2022-06-20,Jixie Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Mechanical Engineering,Bezier curve | jump point optimization | mobile robot | Q value of the guidance | Q-Learning | smooth path,2-s2.0-85136988177,,,Article,Duan S.,60032389;60025152,Hebei University of Technology;University of Cincinnati,Tianjin;Cincinnati,China;United States,4,"Duan, Shuyong;Zhang, Linxin;Han, Xu;Liu, Guirong",56729931800;57802178600;57220964560;8242077900,60032389;60032389;60032389;60025152,20 June 2022,05776686,20948,,Journal,58,11,,72-87,1,,undefined,,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.3901/JME.2022.11.072
10.3389/fpsyg.2022.875382,Combined Effects of Block-Based Programming and Physical Computing on Primary Students' Computational Thinking Skills,"Basic Digital Education (BDE) is already planned to be integrated with the forthcoming curriculum for Austrian primary schools (6–10 years) as it was already implemented for lower secondary schools (10–14 years) in 2018. BDE includes the most essential and novel developments of Computational Thinking (CT), which are fundamentally responsible for nurturing students' problem-solving skills. Thus, evaluating teaching materials, scaffolding guidelines, and assessments is becoming increasingly important for the successful implementation of CT in Austrian classrooms. This study is a part of a longitudinal multi-cycle educational design research project aiming to explore how to foster CT and to raise the awareness, importance, and confidence of teachers and students in applying CT for everyday uses. Our paper focuses on a sub-study in which teaching units for grade 3 and 4 students (8–10 years) were designed by combining an Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook and Physical Computing with the micro:bit device. The designed learning environment consists of three units and was implemented in two classes over 3 weeks. The two classes were further split into two groups each, to ensure better support during implementation. The class teachers received upfront teacher training and conducted pre- and post-test assessments with the students. The resulting data was then analyzed to gain insights into the effects on CT skills of the young learners. Results showed that combining block-based programming and physical computing devices could become a promising approach to promote computational thinking skills in lower school grades. Furthermore, the observed direction of the designed units supports low-barrier access to increase the desired uses of CT in classrooms.",ar,2022-06-08,Frontiers in Psychology,assessment | block-based programming | computational thinking | computer science | integrated learning environment | microbit | physical computing | primary digital education,2-s2.0-85133373500,,,Article,Kastner-Hauler O.,60021931;128301311,Johannes Kepler University Linz;University of Education Lower Austria,Linz;Baden bei Wien,Austria;Austria,4,"Kastner-Hauler, Oliver;Tengler, Karin;Sabitzer, Barbara;Lavicza, Zsolt",57221227453;57331502400;54403944600;35269199400,128301311;128301311;60021931;60021931,8 June 2022,,21100216571,16641078,Journal,13,,875382,,1,,undefined,,4,2022,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.875382

Some methods focus on learning to code while others take a creative programming approach (Resnick & Rusk, 2020). This study looks at creative programming as an opportunity for students to develop their reasoning skills. Drawing from both mathematics teaching and creative programming practices, we identify the elements of informatics thinking and use them to analyze the behaviour of students during a programming task in educational robotics. We also apply certain conceptual tools from both the field of mathematics teaching and the framework of informatics thinking in the course of our study. Creative programming practices provide six factors for analyzing how the students approached situational problems, framed the problems, learned the code, and developed the programs. From a didactics perspective, we use the components of DeBlois’ model (2001, 2003) for interpreting cognitive activities to analyze elements in the knowledge-building process.

A newunified hierarchical formulation of the problem of simultaneous learning and planning (SLAP) isproposed in the context of object-oriented reinforcement learning, and an architecture of acognitive agent that solves this problem is described. A new algorithm for learning actions in apartially observed external environment is proposed using a reward signal, an object-orientedsubject description of the states of the external environment, and dynamically updated actionplans. The main properties and advantages of the proposed algorithm are considered, includingthe lack of a fixed cognitive cycle necessitating the separation of planning and learning subsystemsin earlier algorithms and the ability to construct and update the model of interaction with theenvironment, thus increasing the learning efficiency.

Different from classical heuristic methods, NEED is not designed for some specific environments, which can be applied to various environments. NEED has an encoder-decoder structure, which consists of three modules: convolutional neural network backbone, spatial pooling module, and decoder module. By learning from a number of successful path planning cases, NEED can learn to analyze the environment structure and predict the promising search region for the new path planning problem. This predicted region serves as a heuristic to guide the search direction of path planning algorithms. A series of simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate that NEED significantly improves the algorithm performance on solving new path planning problems. Meanwhile, NEED can also be applied to highly dynamic environments since it can output the prediction results at a speed of over 100 Hz on a laptop.",ar,2022-06-01,IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence,Artificial intelligence in robotics | Intelligent robots | Intelligent systems | Neural networks | Planning,2-s2.0-85132963599,,,Article,Wang J.,60108865;60105683;60010432;60002798,"The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen;Southern University of Science and Technology;Soochow University;Chinese University of Hong Kong",Shenzhen;Shenzhen;Suzhou;Hong Kong,China;China;China;Hong Kong,5,"Wang, Jiankun;Liu, Jianbang;Chen, Weinan;Chi, Wenzheng;Meng, Max Q.H.",57200020647;57214762710;56822663400;55657856900;7102739136,60105683;60002798;60105683;60010432;60105683-60108865-60002798,1 June 2022,,21101093601,26914581,Journal,3,3,,451-460,0,,undefined,,3,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/TAI.2021.3119890
10.3390/rs14122945,Positioning of Quadruped Robot Based on Tightly Coupled LiDAR Vision Inertial Odometer,"Quadruped robots, an important class of unmanned aerial vehicles, have broad potential for applications in education, service, industry, military, and other fields. Their independent positioning plays a key role for completing assigned tasks in a complex environment. However, positioning based on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) may result in GNSS jamming and quadruped robots not operating properly in environments sheltered by buildings. In this paper, a tightly coupled LiDAR vision inertial odometer (LVIO) is proposed to address the positioning inaccuracy of quadruped robots, which have poor mileage information obtained though legs and feet structures only. With this optimization method, the point cloud data obtained by 3D LiDAR, the image feature information obtained by binocular vision, and the IMU inertial data are combined to improve the precise indoor and outdoor positioning of a quadruped robot. This method reduces the errors caused by the uniform motion model in laser odometer as well as the image blur caused by rapid movements of the robot, which can lead to error-matching in a dynamic scene; at the same time, it alleviates the impact of drift on inertial measurements. Finally, the quadruped robot in the laboratory is used to build a physical platform for verification. The experimental results show that the designed LVIO effectively realizes the positioning of four groups of robots with high precision and strong robustness, both indoors or outdoors, which verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.",ar,2022-06-01,Remote Sensing,lidar visual inertial odometer | positioning of quadruped robot | tightly coupled nonlinear optimization,2-s2.0-85132921409,,,Article,Gao F.,60106849,Nanjing Institute of Technology,Nanjing,China,4,"Gao, Fangzheng;Tang, Wenjun;Huang, Jiacai;Chen, Haiyang",35179333200;57765169500;13607631000;55994195100,60106849;60106849;60106849;60106849,June-2 2022,,86430,20724292,Journal,14,12,2945,,1,NSFC,20KJA510007,National Natural Science Foundation of China,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14122945

A versatile and standardized platform is needed to accelerate research and let practitioners focus on the core problems. To this end, we present Agilicious, a codesigned hardware and software framework tailored to autonomous, agile quadrotor flight. It is completely open source and open hardware and supports both model-based and neural network-based controllers. Also, it provides high thrust-to-weight and torque-to-inertia ratios for agility, onboard vision sensors, graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated compute hardware for real-time perception and neural network inference, a real-time flight controller, and a versatile software stack. In contrast to existing frameworks, Agilicious offers a unique combination of flexible software stack and high-performance hardware. We compare Agilicious with prior works and demonstrate it on different agile tasks, using both model-based and neural network-based controllers. Our demonstrators include trajectory tracking at up to 5g and 70 kilometers per hour in a motion capture system, and vision-based acrobatic flight and obstacle avoidance in both structured and unstructured environments using solely onboard perception.

10.3390/su14116625,Innovation of Teaching Tools during Robot Programming Learning to Promote Middle School Students’ Critical Thinking,"In the digital age, robotics education has gained much attention for cultivating learners’ design thinking, creative thinking, critical thinking, and cooperative abilities. In particular, critical thinking as one of the key competencies in Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) can stimulate imagination and creation. It is of great value to explore critical thinking cultivation in robot programming learning. Therefore, this study applied different teaching tools to take the content of “making a manipulator through programming and construction” in a robotics course as an experimental context to examine the promotion of learners’ critical thinking. Before the experiment, a pre-test was conducted to measure students’ critical thinking ability. Then, all students were divided randomly into two groups: one as an experimental group with the teaching tool of Construction–Criticism–Migration (CCM) instructional design, and the other as a control group with the traditional teaching tool of demonstrate–practice instructional design. After a 6-week experiment, the measurement of critical thinking was applied as a post-test. SPSS was used to conduct an independent sample t test and one-way ANOVA to explore whether students’ critical thinking ability had improved and whether differences were found between the experimental group and the control group after the 6-week experiment. The results showed that the experimental group students’ critical thinking ability significantly improved, whereas no significant difference was found before and after the experiment for the control group. A significant difference existed between the two groups.

With the development of artificial intelligence technology and the maturity of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, people put forward higher requirements for the intelligence of robots. Agricultural robots must have intelligent control functions in agricultural scenarios and be able to autonomously decide paths to complete agricultural tasks. In response to this requirement, this paper proposes a Residual-like Soft Actor Critic (R-SAC) algorithm for agricultural scenarios to realize safe obstacle avoidance and intelligent path planning of robots. In addition, in order to alleviate the time-consuming problem of exploration process of reinforcement learning, this paper proposes an offline expert experience pre-training method, which improves the training efficiency of reinforcement learning. Moreover, this paper optimizes the reward mechanism of the algorithm by using multi-step TD-error, which solves the probable dilemma during training.

In particular, an inductive learning model is trained with expert demonstrations and with rules translated into a reward function, while logic programming is used to choose the starting point according to some domain expert’s suggestions. We discuss, as use case, 3-D path planning for neurosurgical steerable needles. Results show that the proposed method computes optimal paths in terms of obstacle clearance and kinematic constraints compliance, and is able to outperform state-of-the-art approaches in terms of safety distance-from-obstacles respect, smoothness, and computational time.",ar,2022-06-01,Autonomous Robots,Answer set programming | Artificial intelligence | Machine learning | Path planning | Steerable needles | Surgical robotics,2-s2.0-85130448918,,,Article,Segato A.,60030318;60024876;60023256;60020261,Università degli Studi di Milano;Humanitas Research Hospital;Politecnico di Milano;Università della Calabria,Milan;Rozzano;Milan;Rende,Italy;Italy;Italy;Italy,6,"Segato, Alice;Calimeri, Francesco;Testa, Irene;Corbetta, Valentina;Riva, Marco;De Momi, Elena",57218375414;8685471300;57701890100;57211219384;57208478311;57203951877,60023256;60020261;60023256;60023256;60030318-60024876;60023256,June 2022,09295593,18016,15737527,Journal,46,5,,645-666,1,H2020,688279,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10514-022-10042-z
10.1145/3506706,Weaving Synchronous Reactions into the Fabric of SSA-form Compilers,"We investigate the programming of reactive systems combining closed-loop control with performance-intensive components such as Machine Learning (ML). Reactive control systems are often safety-critical and associated with real-time execution requirements, a domain of predilection for synchronous programming languages. Extending the high levels of assurance found in reactive control systems to computationally intensive code remains an open issue. We tackle it by unifying concepts and algorithms from synchronous languages with abstractions commonly found in general-purpose and ML compilers. This unification across embedded and high-performance computing enables a high degree of reuse of compiler abstractions and code. We first recall commonalities between dataflow synchronous languages and the static single assignment (SSA) form of general-purpose/ML compilers. We highlight the key mechanisms of synchronous languages that SSA does not cover-denotational concepts such as synchronizing computations with an external time base, cyclic and reactive I/O, as well as the operational notions of relaxing control flow dominance and the modeling of absent values. We discover that initialization-related static analyses and code generation aspects can be fully decoupled from other aspects of synchronous semantics such as memory management and causality analysis, the latter being covered by existing dominance-based algorithms of SSA-form compilers. We show how the SSA form can be seamlessly extended to enable all SSA-based transformations and optimizations on reactive programs with synchronous concurrency. We derive a compilation flow suitable for both high-performance and reactive aspects of a control application, by embedding the Lustre dataflow synchronous language into the SSA-based MLIR/LLVM compiler infrastructure. This allows the modeling of signal processing and deep neural network inference in the (closed) loop of feedback-directed control systems. With only minor efforts leveraging the MLIR infrastructure, the generated code matches or outperforms state-of-the-art synchronous language compilers on computationally intensive ML applications.",ar,2022-06-01,ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization,lustre | machine learning (ML) | MLIR | reactive programming | SSA,2-s2.0-85127744390,,,Article,Pompougnac H.,60111167;60013373,"Google LLC, Europe;INRIA Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique",Dublin;Le Chesnay,Ireland;France,4,"Pompougnac, Hugo;Beaugnon, Ulysse;Cohen, Albert;Butucaru, Dumitru Potop",57565490100;56313507100;57207237960;57566671900,60013373;60111167;60111167;60013373,June 2022,15443566,12100154406,15443973,Journal,19,2,22,,1,,undefined,,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3506706

Software-only robotics researchers usually rely on commercially available robots which, in the case of manipulators, are primarily designed for industrial purposes and are often far from their needs. This article is a hands-on tutorial on the Franka Emika robot, the first series of industrial artificial intelligence (AI)-ready tactile robot platforms. Beyond industrial use, the systems can be seamlessly expanded to fulfill the demands of research and education across all robotics and AI disciplines. To satisfy the needs of such a wide variety of fields, it provides three different interfaces: Desk, a high-level app-based user interface for easy and fast task programming; Robot Integrated Development Environment (RIDE), a command-based programming environment used to create high-performance robot skills that enables programming custom apps and integrating external sensors; and the Franka control interface (FCI), a 1-kHz low-level torque and position control interface that exploits the also-Available Langrangian dynamics robot model.

10.1007/s12369-021-00849-8,Is a Wizard-of-Oz Required for Robot-Led Conversation Practice in a Second Language?,"The large majority of previous work on human-robot conversations in a second language has been performed with a human wizard-of-Oz. The reasons are that automatic speech recognition of non-native conversational speech is considered to be unreliable and that the dialogue management task of selecting robot utterances that are adequate at a given turn is complex in social conversations. This study therefore investigates if robot-led conversation practice in a second language with pairs of adult learners could potentially be managed by an autonomous robot. We first investigate how correct and understandable transcriptions of second language learner utterances are when made by a state-of-the-art speech recogniser. We find both a relatively high word error rate (41%) and that a substantial share (42%) of the utterances are judged to be incomprehensible or only partially understandable by a human reader. We then evaluate how adequate the robot utterance selection is, when performed manually based on the speech recognition transcriptions or autonomously using (a) predefined sequences of robot utterances, (b) a general state-of-the-art language model that selects utterances based on learner input or the preceding robot utterance, or (c) a custom-made statistical method that is trained on observations of the wizard’s choices in previous conversations. It is shown that adequate or at least acceptable robot utterances are selected by the human wizard in most cases (96%), even though the ASR transcriptions have a high word error rate. Further, the custom-made statistical method performs as well as manual selection of robot utterances based on ASR transcriptions. It was also found that the interaction strategy that the robot employed, which differed regarding how much the robot maintained the initiative in the conversation and if the focus of the conversation was on the robot or the learners, had marginal effects on the word error rate and understandability of the transcriptions but larger effects on the adequateness of the utterance selection. Autonomous robot-led conversations may hence work better with some robot interaction strategies.",ar,2022-06-01,International Journal of Social Robotics,Conversational practice | Dialogue management for spoken human-robot interaction | Non-native speech recognition | Robot-assisted language learning,2-s2.0-85122404446,,,Article,Engwall O.,60019656;60002014,Heriot-Watt University;The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),Edinburgh;Stockholm,United Kingdom;Sweden,3,"Engwall, Olov;Lopes, José;Cumbal, Ronald",6506726055;55944443800;57216333110,60002014;60019656;60002014,June 2022,18754791,19500157063,18754805,Journal,14,4,,1067-1085,1,VR,MAW 2020.0052,Vetenskapsrådet,5,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12369-021-00849-8
10.1109/TBME.2021.3133075,Inverse Reinforcement Learning Intra-Operative Path Planning for Steerable Needle,"Objective: This paper presentsa safe and effective keyhole neurosurgery intra-operative planning framework for flexible neurosurgical robots. The framework is intended to support neurosurgeons during the intra-operative procedure to react to a dynamic environment. Methods: The proposed system integrates inverse reinforcement learning path planning algorithm combined with 1) a pre-operative path planning framework for fast and intuitive user interaction, 2) a realistic, time-bounded simulator based on Position-based Dynamics (PBD) simulation that mocks brain deformations due to catheter insertion and 3) a simulated robotic system. Results: Simulation results performed on a human brain dataset show that the inverse reinforcement learning intra-operative planning method can guide a steerable needle with bounded curvature to a predefined target pose with an average targeting error of 1.34 pm 0.52 (25{th} = 1.02, 75{th} = 1.36) mm in position and 3.16 pm 1.06 (25{th} = 2, 75{th} = 4.94) degrees in orientation under a deformable simulated environment, with a re-planning time of 0.02 sec and a success rate of 100%.

10.1002/rob.22052,Highly optimized Q-learning-based bees approach for mobile robot path planning in static and dynamic environments,This paper proposes a new novel approach to find an optimal path for a mobile robot in a two-dimensional environment. Finding the optimal path is done using the Bees Algorithm (BA) with the Q-Learning Algorithm. A new method to build the initial population is proposed to find the initial population regardless of the number and location of obstacles in the environment. Q-Learning is implemented as a local search function of the BA. The hybridization of the BA and the Q-Learning aims to find the optimal path with a fewer number of iterations of the BA. This method takes advantage of the BA to solve the problem without constraints and the sterilization in the Q-Learning to find the shortest path. The experiment is run on some different maps to validate the proposed method in the static and dynamic case. The experimental results show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method in finding the optimal path. The comparison is executed to view the superiority of this method in finding the shortest path in the comparison of the results of other algorithms.,ar,2022-06-01,Journal of Field Robotics,Dynamic obstacle avoidance | machine learning | Optimization | path plannin of mobile robot,2-s2.0-85120943256,,,Article,Bonny T.,60070813,University of Sharjah,Sharjah,United Arab Emirates,2,"Bonny, Talal;Kashkash, Mariam",15060068900;57200450345,60070813;60070813,June 2022,15564959,4700152301,15564967,Journal,39,4,,317-334,0,,undefined,,9,2022,https://doi.org/10.1002/rob.22052

These changes may exhibit some hidden structure, which can be learned. Many studies consider reactive algorithms for online planning, however, these algorithms do not take advantage of the past executions of the navigation task for future tasks. In this article, we formalize the problem of minimizing the total expected cost to perform multiple start-To-goal navigation tasks on a roadmap by introducing the learned reactive planning problem. We propose a method that captures information from past executions to learn a motion policy to handle obstacles that the robot has seen before. We propose the LAMP framework, which integrates the generated motion policy with an existing navigation stack. Finally, an extensive set of experiments in simulated and real-world environments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-The-Art algorithms by 10% to 40% in terms of expected time to travel from start to goal. We also evaluate the robustness of the proposed method in the presence of localization and mapping errors on a real robot.",ar,2022-06-01,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,Active sensing | learning and adaptive systems | motion and path planning | reactive and sensor-based planning,2-s2.0-85115665181,,,Article,Tsang F.,60014171,University of Waterloo,Waterloo,Canada,5,"Tsang, Florence;Walker, Tristan;MacDonald, Ryan A.;Sadeghi, Armin;Smith, Stephen L.",57210795627;57221695985;57197842005;57212402979;55574212853,60014171;60014171;60014171;60014171;60014171,1 June 2022,15523098,95101,19410468,Journal,38,3,,1638-1652,0,,undefined,,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2021.3109414

The review presents empirical investigations with young learners and reports on relevant frameworks and curriculum programs, effects of teaching approaches and educational tools on learning, and learning outcomes and pedagogical benefits of teaching programming. Based on the empirical studies reviewed in this study, programming can be introduced to young learners as a stand-alone subject matter or can be integrated in the regular kindergarten curriculum with other subject areas such as music, movement and dance, art, science, mathematics, and literacy. In addition, programming can be infused in literacy and storytelling activities as a developmentally appropriate delivery approach.

Through various approaches, robots are being used in the teaching and learning of different subjects at distinct education levels. The present study investigates the effects of an educational robotic intervention on the mental rotation and computational thinking assessment in a 3rd grade classroom. To this end, we carried out a quasi-experimental study involving 24 third-grade students.

10.1109/TCDS.2021.3063273,Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Optimal Path Planning,"Path planning plays an important role in autonomous robot systems. Effective understanding of the surrounding environment and efficient generation of an optimal collision-free path are both critical parts for solving path-planning problems. Although conventional sampling-based algorithms, such as the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) and its improved optimal version (RRT∗), have been widely used in path-planning problems because of their ability to find a feasible path in even complex environments, they fail to find an optimal path efficiently. To solve this problem and satisfy the two aforementioned requirements, we propose a novel learning-based path-planning algorithm which consists of a novel generative model based on the conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) and a modified RRT∗ algorithm (denoted by CGAN-RRT∗). Given the map information, our CGAN model can generate an efficient probability distribution of feasible paths, which can be utilized by the CGAN-RRT∗ algorithm to find an optimal path with a nonuniform sampling strategy. The CGAN model is trained by learning from ground-truth maps, each of which is generated by putting all the results of executing the RRT algorithm 50 times on one raw map. We demonstrate the efficient performance of this CGAN model by testing it on two groups of maps and comparing the CGAN-RRT∗ algorithm with the Informed-RRT∗ algorithm and conventional RRT∗ algorithm.",ar,2022-06-01,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems,Conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) | optimal path planning | sampling-based path planning,2-s2.0-85102259324,,,Article,Ma N.,60108865;60105683;60002798,"The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen;Southern University of Science and Technology;Chinese University of Hong Kong",Shenzhen;Shenzhen;Hong Kong,China;China;Hong Kong,4,"Ma, Nachuan;Wang, Jiankun;Liu, Jianbang;Meng, Max Q.H.",57214754979;57200020647;57214762710;7102739136,60105683;60105683;60002798;60002798-60108865,1 June 2022,23798920,21100784665,23798939,Journal,14,2,,662-671,0,,undefined,,6,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/TCDS.2021.3063273

Such integration must not solely emphasise CT problem-solving skills. Rather, it must provide students with interactive learning to support their target-language (TL) interaction while reducing potential TL anxiety. This study aimed to validate the effects of the proposed method of pair programming (PP) along with question-and-response interaction in a board-game activity on young learners’ CT skills and TL learning across contexts. Two Grade 6 classes, one with 15 students who were studying Chinese as a Second Language (CSL) and the other with 15 students who were studying English as a Foreign Language (EFL), participated in the activity. A series of instruments on achievement assessment, questionnaires on CT skills and TL anxiety, and sequential learning behaviour analysis were used to critically examine the results. The main conclusion is that the EFL group showed better social skills of cooperation on CT and lower TL learning anxiety, while the CSL group demonstrated better problem-solving skills in CT, but presented more behaviours of trial-and-error loops.

10.3389/fnbot.2022.883562,Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Trajectory Planning Under Uncertain Constraints,"With the advance in algorithms, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers solutions to trajectory planning under uncertain environments. Different from traditional trajectory planning which requires lots of effort to tackle complicated high-dimensional problems, the recently proposed DRL enables the robot manipulator to autonomously learn and discover optimal trajectory planning by interacting with the environment. In this article, we present state-of-the-art DRL-based collision-avoidance trajectory planning for uncertain environments such as a safe human coexistent environment. Since the robot manipulator operates in high dimensional continuous state-action spaces, model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic (SAC), and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) framework are adapted to our scenario for comparison. In order to assess our proposal, we simulate a 7-DOF Panda (Franka Emika) robot manipulator in the PyBullet physics engine and then evaluate its trajectory planning with reward, loss, safe rate, and accuracy.

10.3390/s22103746,Computational Thinking and Educational Robotics Integrated into Project-Based Learning,"In the context of the science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics disciplines in education, subjects tend to use contextualized activities or projects. Educational robotics and computational thinking both have the potential to become subjects in their own right, though not all educational programs yet offer these. Despite the use of technology and programming platforms being widespread, it is not common practice to integrate computational thinking and educational robotics into the official curriculum in secondary education. That is why this paper continues an initial project of integrating computational thinking and educational robotics into a secondary school in Barcelona, Spain. This study presents a project-based learning approach where the main focus is the development of skills related to science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics and the acquisition of computational thinking knowledge in the second year of pupils’ studies using a block-based programming environment. The study develops several sessions in the context of project-based learning, with students using the block-programming platform Scratch™. During these sessions and in small-group workshops, students will expand their knowledge of computational thinking and develop 21st-century skills. We demonstrate the superior improvement of these concepts and skills compared to other educational methodologies.",ar,2022-05-01,Sensors,computational thinking | educational robotics | project-based learning | STEAM,2-s2.0-85129841562,,,Article,Pou A.V.,60026905,Universitat Ramon Llull,Barcelona,Spain,3,"Pou, Albert Valls;Canaleta, Xavi;Fonseca, David",57680085100;6504566554;35224644800,60026905;60026905;60026905,May-2 2022,14248220,130124,,Journal,22,10,3746,,1,,2021-URL-Proj-057,,9,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22103746
10.3390/s22093579,Efficient Path Planning for Mobile Robot Based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient,"When a traditional Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm is used in mobile robot path planning, due to the limited observable environment of mobile robots, the training efficiency of the path planning model is low, and the convergence speed is slow. In this paper, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is introduced into the DDPG network, the former and current states of the mobile robot are combined to determine the actions of the robot, and a Batch Norm layer is added after each layer of the Actor network. At the same time, the reward function is optimized to guide the mobile robot to move faster towards the target point. In order to improve the learning efficiency, different normalization methods are used to normalize the distance and angle between the mobile robot and the target point, which are used as the input of the DDPG network model. When the model outputs the next action of the mobile robot, mixed noise composed of Gaussian noise and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) noise is added. Finally, the simulation environment built by a ROS system and a Gazebo platform is used for experiments. The results show that the proposed algorithm can accelerate the convergence speed of DDPG, improve the generalization ability of the path planning model and improve the efficiency and success rate of mobile robot path planning.",ar,2022-05-01,Sensors,DDPG | LSTM | mixed noise | path planning | reward function,2-s2.0-85129732136,,35591271,Article,Gong H.,60011592;60008562,Qilu University of Technology;Shandong Jiaotong University,Jinan;Jinan,China;China,4,"Gong, Hui;Wang, Peng;Ni, Cui;Cheng, Nuo",57673780300;57007320800;56513255900;57673780400,60008562;60008562-60011592;60008562;60008562,May-1 2022,14248220,130124,,Journal,22,9,3579,,1,DTSP,2021M702030,China Postdoctoral Science Foundation,11,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22093579

The problem addresses the computation of a collision-free optimal path from a predefined initial position to target position during transportation of stick or object cooperatively by robot pair in the multi-robot environment. The stick carrying application has been resolved by embedding the modified Q-learning into the hybrid process of an improved version of particle swarm optimization and intelligent water drop algorithm. In the present context, modified Q-learning generates the best solution for particle swarm optimization and particle swarm optimization is upgraded through the perception of cubic spline and generate the optimal position in the successive iteration using intelligent water drop algorithm and also enhances the intensification and diversification capability of particle swarm optimization. The proposed hybrid algorithm computes the collision-free subsequent position for each robot pair by avoiding the obstacles in its path, avoiding the trapping at the local optima, improving the convergence speed, optimizing the path distance for every pair of robots, energy usage and path smoothness both in the static and dynamic environment's. The validation of the proposed hybrid algorithm has been verified and checked the robustness of the algorithm through computer simulation and real robots through Webots simulator. Further, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm has been verified by comparing the result obtained proposed algorithm and its competitor algorithms and comparing the result of the proposed algorithm with the existing state-of arts.

10.1145/3480947,"Myths and mythconceptions: What does it mean to be a programming language, anyhow?","Modern software does not stand alone; it is embedded in complex physical and sociotechnical systems. It relies on computational support from interdependent subsystems as well as non-code resources such as data, communications, sensors, and interactions with humans. Both general-purpose programming languages and mainstream programming language research focus on symbolic notations with well-defined abstractions that are intended for use by professionals to write programs that solve precisely specified problems. There is a strong emphasis on correctness of the resulting programs, preferably by formal reasoning. However, these languages, despite their careful design and formal foundations, address only a modest portion of modern software and only a minority of software developers. Several persistent myths reinforce this focus. These myths express an idealized model of software and software development. They provide a lens for examining modern software and software development practice: highly trained professionals are outnumbered by vernacular developers. Writing new code is dominated by composition of ill-specified software and non-software components. General-purpose languages may be less appropriate for a task than domain-specific languages, and functional correctness is often a less appropriate goal than overall fitness for task. Support for programming to meet a specification is of little help to people who are programming in order to understand their problems. Reasoning about software is challenged by uncertainty and nondeterminism in the execution environment and by the increasingly dominant role of data, especially with the advent of systems that rely on machine learning. The lens of our persistent myths illuminates the dissonance between our idealized view of software development and common practice, which enables us to identify emerging opportunities and challenges for programming language research.",ar,2022-04-04,Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages,closed software system | domain-specific programming language | exploratory programming | fitness to task | formal specifications | general-purpose programming language | generality-power tradeoffs | open resource coalition | problem-setting design | problem-solving design | software credentials | sufficient correctness | vernacular software developer,2-s2.0-85128953457,,,Article,Shaw M.,60027950,Carnegie Mellon University,Pittsburgh,United States,1,"Shaw, Mary",7401651885,60027950,4 April 2022,,21101020042,24751421,Journal,4,HOPL,234,,1,,undefined,,3,2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3480947
10.3390/electronics11081240,Real-Time Facial Expression Recognition Using Deep Learning with Application in the Active Classroom Environment,"The quality of a teaching method used in a classroom can be assessed by observing the facial expressions of students. To automate this, Facial Expression Recognition (FER) can be employed. Based on the recognized emotions of students, teachers can improve their lectures by determining which activities during the lecture evoke which emotions and how these emotions are related to the tasks solved by the students. Previous work mostly addresses the problem in the context of passive teaching, where teachers present while students listen and take notes, and usually in online courses. We take this a step further and develop predictive models that can classify emotions in the context of active teaching, specifically a robotics workshop, which is more challenging. The two best generalizing models (Inception-v3 and ResNet-34) on the test set were combined with the goal of real-time emotion prediction on videos of workshop participants solving eight tasks using an educational robot. As a proof of concept, we applied the models to the video data and analyzed the predicted emotions with regard to activities, tasks, and gender of the participants. Statistical analysis showed that female participants were more likely to show emotions in almost all activity types. In addition, for all activity types, the emotion of happiness was most likely regardless of gender. Finally, the activity type in which the analyzed emotions were the most frequent was programming. These results indicate that students’ facial expressions are related to the activities they are currently engaged in and contain valuable information for teachers about what they can improve in their teaching practice.",ar,2022-04-01,Electronics (Switzerland),active teaching | convolutional neural network | educational robot | facial expression recognition | Inception-v3 | ResNet-34,2-s2.0-85128355248,,,Article,Dukić D.,60159855,"University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing",Zagreb,Croatia,2,"Dukić, David;Krzic, Ana Sovic",57220989496;57539321000,60159855;60159855,April-2 2022,,21100829272,20799292,Journal,11,8,1240,,1,HRZZ,UIP-2017-05-5917 HRZZ-TRES,Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost,7,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics11081240
10.3390/mi13040564,Dual-Arm Robot Trajectory Planning Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning under Complex Environment,"In this article, the trajectory planning of the two manipulators of the dual-arm robot is studied to approach the patient in a complex environment with deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The shape of the human body and bed is complex which may lead to the collision between the human and the robot. Because the sparse reward the robot obtains from the environment may not support the robot to accomplish the task, a neural network is trained to control the manipulators of the robot to prepare to hold the patient up by using a proximal policy optimization algorithm with a continuous reward function. Firstly, considering the realistic scene, the 3D simulation environment is built to conduct the research. Secondly, inspired by the idea of the artificial potential field, a new reward and punishment function was proposed to help the robot obtain enough rewards to explore the environment. The function is consisting of four parts which include the reward guidance function, collision detection, obstacle avoidance function, and time function. Where the reward guidance function is used to guide the robot to approach the targets to hold the patient, the collision detection and obstacle avoidance function are complementary to each other and are used to avoid obstacles, and the time function is used to reduce the number of training episode. Finally, after the robot is trained to reach the targets, the training results are analyzed. Compared with the DDPG algorithm, the PPO algorithm reduces about 4 million steps for training to converge. Moreover, compared with the other reward and punishment functions, the function used in this paper will obtain many more rewards at the same training time. Apart from that, it will take much less time to converge, and the episode length will be shorter; so, the advantage of the algorithm used in this paper is verified.",ar,2022-04-01,Micromachines,complex environment | deep reinforcement learning | dual-arm robot | reward | trajectory planning,2-s2.0-85128288553,,,Article,Tang W.,60104225;60024350;60017605,Jiangxi University of Science and Technology;National University of Defense Technology China;Fuzhou University,Ganzhou;Changsha;Fuzhou,China;China;China,4,"Tang, Wanxing;Cheng, Chuang;Ai, Haiping;Chen, Li",57578716100;57219420833;57208622245;57022287600,60104225-60017605;60024350;60104225;60017605,April 2022,,21100229176,2072666X,Journal,13,4,564,,1,NSFC,11372073,National Natural Science Foundation of China,3,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13040564
10.1109/TLT.2022.3162895,The Effect on Computational Thinking Using SRA-Programming: Anticipating Changes in a Dynamic Problem Environment,"This article illustrates that the task design and problem selection are of characteristic influence to evoke sense-reason-act programming (SRA) among primary school pupils when programming robots. Research shows that the task design influences the development of computational thinking (CT). The literature provides evidence that the context, the problem space, and the representation of the problem to apply SRA-programming require the programming task to be embedded in a dynamic context in which a programmable robot must use sensory information to anticipate changes in the environment. In order to ascertain whether the problem space and the task design influence the evocation of SRA-thinking, this article uses a research design comparing the differences between two programming conditions (static/dynamic). In these conditions, pupils use Lego EV-3 robots and Mindstorms software to solve programming problems. As a post-measurement, a Lego challenge is applied. In this article, it is shown that the integration of a dynamic task design to solve a programming problem is essential for a deeper understanding of CT skills. Furthermore, when pupils can immediately test the consequences of their program in a dynamic environment and, thus, the learning environment provides an appropriate problem, they gain a deeper understanding of the added value of sensors and will be better able to reason about complex problems. It is found that programming in a dynamic problem environment almost naturally evokes SRA-thinking, as opposed to programming in a static environment.

The model trained with MobileNet convolutional neural network had an accuracy of 56.25%, performing better than ResNet50 and VGG16.

The output of the machine learning algorithm involved in PandaSays is sent to the humanoid robot to execute some actions as singing, dancing, and so on. Alpha 1 Pro has its own programming language—Blockly—and, in order to give the robot specific commands, Bluetooth programming is used, with the help of a Raspberry Pi.

Safe and efficient navigation in such environments requires a precise motion model of an AUV. However, the motion of an AUV is difficult to be accurately predicted due to its nonlinear dynamics significantly affected by its surrounding fluids. To resolve this difficulty, we propose to use a Bayes Adaptive Markov Decision Process (BA-MDP) for robust decision making, which is able to hedge against errors in the AUV's motion model through online learning. To construct the BA-MDP accurately, a Clustering Guided Explorative Tree (CGETree) is proposed to explore all the possible connectivities within the AUV's state space in an offline manner. The CGETree's nodes are clustered together to provide a discretization of the state space, and the tree edges, after being combined with a discrete noise model, provide a physics-based-prior for the transition model, which will be updated online along with the robot's movement.

10.1109/LRA.2022.3158377,Robotic Cable Routing with Spatial Representation,"Cable routing is a challenging task for robotic automation. To accomplish the task, it requires a high-level path planner to generate a sequence of cable configurations from the initial state to the target state and a low-level manipulation planner to plan the robot motion commands to transit between adjacent states. However, there are yet no proper representations to model the cable with the environment objects, impeding the design of both high-level path planning and low-level manipulation planning. In this letter, we propose a framework for cable routing with spatial representation. For high-level planning, by considering the spatial relations between the cable and the environment objects such as fixtures, the proposed method is able to plan a path from the initial state to the goal state in a graph. For low-level manipulation, multiple manipulation primitives are efficiently learned from human demonstration, to configure the cable to planned intermediate states leveraging the same spatial representation. We also implement a cable state estimator that robustly extracts the spatial representation from raw RGB-D images, thus completing the cable routing framework.

MLNav makes judicious use of machine learning to enhance the efficiency of path planning while fully respecting safety constraints. In particular, the dominant computational cost in such safety-critical settings is running a model-based safety checker on the proposed paths. Our learned search heuristic can simultaneously predict the feasibility for all path options in a single run, and the model-based safety checker is only invoked on the top-scoring paths. We validate in high-fidelity simulations using both real Martian terrain data collected by the Perseverance rover, as well as a suite of challenging synthetic terrains. Our experiments show that: (i) compared to the baseline ENav path planner on board the Perserverance rover, MLNav can provide a significant improvement in multiple key metrics, such as a 10x reduction in collision checks when navigating real Martian terrains, despite being trained with synthetic terrains; and (ii) MLNav can successfully navigate highly challenging terrains where the baseline ENav fails to find a feasible path before timing out.",ar,2022-04-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Integrated planning and learning | Motion and path planningc | space robotics and automation,2-s2.0-85126275807,,,Article,Daftry S.,60028079;60022195;60009037;112774009,Manipal Institute of Technology;Massachusetts Institute of Technology;Jet Propulsion Laboratory;California Institute of Science and Technology,Manipal;Cambridge;Pasadena;Pasadena,India;United States;United States;United States,10,"Daftry, Shreyansh;Abcouwer, Neil;Sesto, Tyler Del;Venkatraman, Siddarth;Song, Jialin;Igel, Lucas;Byon, Amos;Rosolia, Ugo;Yue, Yisong;Ono, Masahiro",54956672300;57194611220;57557278800;57219545407;57211265817;57487089700;57220009856;56764652400;23013485900;36601001300,60009037;60009037;60009037;60028079;112774009;60022195;60009037;112774009;112774009;60009037,1 April 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,2,,5461-5468,0,,undefined,,4,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3156654
10.1016/j.compag.2022.106824,Three-dimensional pose detection method based on keypoints detection network for tomato bunch,"Non-destructive picking of fresh tomatoes is a delicate agronomical operation, based on comprehensive information about the plant organ, such as the location of stem, peduncle, and fruits. The matching between visual information supply and information demand from the agronomical technic is the key power to promote the picking robot from the laboratory to the field. The three-dimensional pose information, containing the location of each organ of the plant, can meet the demand of agronomical technic. It is the premise of precisely handling the cluster of fruits. In order to realize the fine tomato bunch harvesting operation in a bunch, this paper proposed a three-dimensional pose detection method for tomato bunch. The method, named Tomato Pose Method (TPM), is composed of a priori geometric model, a cascaded multi-task network, and a three-dimensional reconstruction process. Based on prior knowledge and agronomic technology, this prior geometric model comprehensively and flexibly describes the spatial location information of tomato bunch. The cascaded multi-task network is designed based on hourglass structure and transfer learning, which is suitable for bounding box and key point prediction of tomato bunches in complex environments. Finally, combining the prior geometric model and the spatial position information of each key point, the tomato bunch is reconstructed. Only a medium training dataset, containing 1800 RGBD images covering changing lighting, occlusion, and various poses, is needed for training. Its success rate of TPM on two-dimensional keypoint detection is 94.02%, the accuracy of 85.77% predicted points are at medium level. And 70.05% tomato bunch with multi-pose can be constructed. More importantly, this method only needs one RGBD image taken by a commercial camera to realize the three-dimensional reconstruction of a single-bunch scenario in 1.0 s, and a multi-bunch scenario in 2.0 s. It provides comprehensive information, and provides data basis for target positioning and path planning of picking robot, which makes the non-destructive harvesting possible.",ar,2022-04-01,Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,Deep learning | Harvesting robot | Hourglass structure | Keypoints detection | Tomato bunch,2-s2.0-85126014781,S0168169922001417,,Article,Zhang F.,60013551,China Agricultural University,Beijing,China,6,"Zhang, Fan;Gao, Jin;Zhou, Hang;Zhang, Junxiong;Zou, Kunlin;Yuan, Ting",57208263334;57205197239;57219968701;56414383300;57213421274;57205195453,60013551;60013551;60013551;60013551;60013551;60013551,April 2022,01681699,30441,,Journal,195,,106824,,0,MOST,CN 2016YFD0701,Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China,9,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2022.106824

These constraints require proper motion planning of the soft material-based body that can be axially compressed. In this letter, we derive the compressible curvature kinematics of a cable-driven soft robot which takes the undesirable axial compression caused by the cable-driven mechanism into account. Robot motion planning for tip trajectory tracking tasks in constrained conditions, including fixed orientation tip and manipulator-obstacle collision avoidance, are investigated. The inverse solution of cable actuation is formulated as a damped least-square optimization problem and iteratively computed off-line. The performance of path and trajectory tracking, and the obedience to constraints are evaluated via the simulation we make open-source, as well as prototype experiments. The method can be generalized to similar multisegment cable-driven soft robotic systems by customizing the robot parameters for the prior motion planning in tip trajectory following tasks.",ar,2022-04-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,and learning for soft robots | constrained motion planning | control | Modeling | whole-body motion planning and control,2-s2.0-85125360332,,,Article,Lai J.,60010432;60008928,Soochow University;The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Suzhou;Hong Kong,China;Hong Kong,4,"Lai, Jiewen;Lu, Bo;Zhao, Qingxiang;Chu, Henry K.",57211745548;56637501600;57204210552;57193015420,60008928;60010432;60008928;60008928,1 April 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,2,,4813-4820,0,,undefined,,7,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3152318
10.1109/LRA.2022.3152322,Planning of Soft-Rigid Hybrid Arms in Contact with Compliant Environment: Application to the Transrectal Biopsy of the Prostate,"In this study, a rigid robot is hybridized with a soft part to improve its properties of relative positioning and safe interaction. While the design of the device is quite simple, the kinematics, on the other hand, becomes complex. Pre-operative planning of such a robot is a challenge that is faced in this letter. The clinical context is the automation of transrectal prostate biopsy: a robot is connected to a thin ultrasound (US) probe instrumented with a needle through a flexible silicone part. The procedure consists of: moving the probe near the prostate through the rectum, aligning the probe with identified lesions in the prostate, and shooting the needle to collect tissue samples. In this letter we demonstrate in simulation the feasibility of our methods to solve the planning of the entire procedure. The approach we propose is based on numerical models of both robot and soft tissues, using the Finite Element Method (FEM) to model the soft parts, and a mapping mechanism to propagate the forces and displacements between the soft and rigid models. Finally, we extend the optimization algorithm proposed in previous work for the relative positioning of the hybrid robot on targets in the prostate, as it interacts with the soft tissues. With this formulation we can also set an upper limit to the force the robot is applying on its surroundings, which is particularly critical for the application we study in this letter.",ar,2022-04-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,and learning for soft robots | Constrained motion planning. modeling | control,2-s2.0-85125335743,,,Article,Coevoet E.,60104665;60017293,Université de Lille;Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II,Lille;Naples,France;Italy,5,"Coevoet, Eulalie;Adagolodjo, Yinoussa;Lin, Meichun;Duriez, Christian;Ficuciello, Fanny",56352486400;57118053600;57468851700;56416177200;36801496500,60017293-60104665;60104665;60017293-60104665;60104665;60017293,1 April 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,2,,4853-4860,0,,undefined,,3,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3152322

Applications involving highly cluttered or occluded workspaces prevent the effective use of vision. To address some of the challenges that arise, we propose an approach that instead utilizes force and torque measurements at the robot end-effector to solve for possible contact locations and probabilistically determine the occupancy likelihood on a 3D map. Our procedure constructs two occupancy maps: one fixed that represents the environment and another map that moves with the robot end-effector and reconstructs the grasped object shape, where each map informs the probability updates on the other. The algorithm is applied and tested on two scenarios: retrieving a tangled object from a scene and reconstructing the geometry of an object.

The problem addresses the stick transportation by robot pairs from the predefined starting position to the pre-assumed goal position. This paper describes the method of computing collision-free paths for multiple numbers of paired robots called twins using a hybrid algorithm with balanced local exploitation and global exploration. The hybrid algorithm is designed by combining the individual benefits of the improved Q-Learning (IQ) and democratic robotics particle swarm optimization (DRPSO). The main intention of IQ is to produce the best position with collision avoidance by executing the best state-action pair. DRPSO algorithm computes the optimal trajectory for the twin robot using the distributed democratic approach and enhances the intensification capability. The twin robots are synchronized to the number of steps, turns, the direction of movement, and distance between both of them in the proposed approach. Computer simulation results reveal the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in both paths travelled and runtime. The experimental and VREP simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm offers better synchronization, cooperation, and performance in terms of several parameters such as path length, path deviation, run time, and path smoothness as a replica of the number of turns made. The comparative study with artificial bee colony optimization (ABCO) and imperialist competitive firefly algorithm (ICFA) witnesses the superiority of the hybrid IQ-DRPSO algorithm. Experiments that have been conducted through Arduino bots in a real environment prove the efficiency of the proposed approach.

10.1109/LRA.2022.3151433,Kinematic Motion Retargeting via Neural Latent Optimization for Learning Sign Language,"Motion retargeting from a human demonstration to a robot is an effective way to reduce the professional requirements and workload of robot programming, but faces the challenges resulting from the differences between humans and robots. Traditional optimization-based methods are time-consuming and rely heavily on good initialization, while recent studies using feedforward neural networks suffer from poor generalization to unseen motions. Moreover, they neglect the topological information in human skeletons and robot structures. In this paper, we propose a novel neural latent optimization approach to address these problems. Latent optimization utilizes a decoder to establish a mapping between the latent space and the robot motion space. Afterward, the retargeting results that satisfy robot constraints can be obtained by searching for the optimal latent vector. Alongside with latent optimization, neural initialization exploits an encoder to provide a better initialization for faster and better convergence of optimization. Both the human skeleton and the robot structure are modeled as graphs to make better use of topological information. We perform experiments on retargeting Chinese sign language, which involves two arms and two hands, with additional requirements on the relative relationships among joints. Experiments include retargeting various human demonstrations to YuMi, NAO, and Pepper in the simulation environment and to YuMi in the real-world environment.

Recently, automated EV charging systems have received huge attention to improve users' experience and to efficiently utilize charging infrastructures and parking lots. However, most related works have focused on system design, robot control, planning, and manipulation. Towards robust EV charging inlet detection, we propose a new dataset (EVCI dataset) and a novel data augmentation method that is based on image-to-image translation where typical image-to-image translation methods synthesize a new image in a different domain given an image. To the best of our knowledge, the EVCI dataset is the first EV charging inlet dataset. For the data augmentation method, we focus on being able to control synthesized images' captured environments (e.g., time, lighting) in an intuitive way. To achieve this, we first propose the environment guide vector that humans can intuitively interpret. We then propose a novel image-to-image translation network that translates a given image towards the environment described by the vector. Accordingly, it aims to synthesize a new image that has the same content as the given image while looking like captured in the provided environment by the environment guide vector. Lastly, we train a detection method using the augmented dataset. Through experiments on the EVCI dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

However, it is still challenging to use learning-based methods under uncertain environments while stability, safety, and real-time performance of the system are desired to guarantee. In this letter, we propose a learning-based tracking control scheme based on a feedback linearization controller in which uncertain disturbances are approximated online using Gaussian Processes (GPs). Using the predicted distribution of disturbances given by GPs, a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and Control Barrier Function (CBF) based Quadratic Program is applied, with which probabilistic stability and safety are guaranteed. In addition, the trajectory is optimized first by Model Predictive Control (MPC) based on the linearized dynamics systems to further reduce the tracking error. We also design an event trigger for GPs updates to improve efficiency while stability and safety of the system are still guaranteed.

Motion planning algorithms, and their underlying collision checkers, are crucial to any robot control stack. Collision checking takes up a large portion of the computational time in robot motion planning. Existing collision checkers make trade-offs between speed and accuracy and scale poorly to high-dimensional, complex environments. We present a novel space decomposition method using K-Means clustering in the Forward Kinematics space to accelerate proxy collision checking. We train individual configuration space models using Fastron, a kernel perceptron algorithm, on these decomposed subspaces, yielding compact yet highly accurate models that can be queried rapidly and scale better to more complex environments.

10.1109/LRA.2022.3145517,Competence-Aware Path Planning Via Introspective Perception,"Robots deployed in the real world over extendedperiods of time need to reason about unexpected failures, learn to predict them, and to proactively take actions to avoid future failures. Existing approaches for competence-aware planning are either model-based, requiring explicit enumeration of known failure sources, or purely statistical, using state- and location-specific failure statistics to infer competence. We instead propose a structured model-free approach to competence-aware planning by reasoning about plan execution failures due to errors in perception, without requiring a priori enumeration of failure sources or requiring location-specific failure statistics. We introduce competence-aware path planning via introspective perception (CPIP), a Bayesian framework to iteratively learn and exploit task-level competence in novel deployment environments. CPIP factorizes the competence-aware planning problem into two components. First, perception errors are learned in a model-free and location-agnostic setting via introspective perception prior to deployment in novel environments. Second, during actual deployments, the prediction of task-level failures is learned in a context-aware setting. Experiments in a simulation show that the proposed CPIP approach outperforms the frequentist baseline in multiple mobile robot tasks, and is further validated via real robot experiments in environments with perceptually challenging obstacles and terrain.",ar,2022-04-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,failure detection and recovery | Motion and path planning | visual learning,2-s2.0-85123739303,,,Article,Rabiee S.,60014313;60013372;124041089,University of Massachusetts Amherst;The University of Texas at Austin;Alliance Innovation Lab Silicon Valley,Amherst;Austin;Santa Clara,United States;United States;United States,5,"Rabiee, Sadegh;Basich, Connor;Wray, Kyle Hollins;Zilberstein, Shlomo;Biswas, Joydeep",57190337909;57215351127;57002971000;6603805660;35774160500,60013372;60014313;124041089;60014313;60013372,1 April 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,2,,3218-3225,0,NSF,CAREER-2046955,National Science Foundation,3,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3145517

Multiple robots allow performing complex tasks with greater efficiency. However, this leads to increased complexity in planning and dispatching actions to robots. In this letter, we tackle such complexity using a hierarchical planning framework: the task is first planned at an abstract level and then refined by local motion planning. We propose a framework based on a state-transition system formalism that abstracts the problem by removing unnecessary details and, hence, considerably reduces planning space complexity. Forward search from an initial state allows the robot to find a sequence of actions to accomplish the assigned task.

10.1109/LRA.2022.3145971,Focus on Impact: Indoor Exploration with Intrinsic Motivation,"Exploration of indoor environments has recently experienced a significant interest, also thanks to the introduction of deep neural agents built in a hierarchical fashion and trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) on simulated environments. Current state-of-the-art methods employ a dense extrinsic reward that requires the complete a priori knowledge of the layout of the training environment to learn an effective exploration policy. However, such information is expensive to gather in terms of time and resources. In this work, we propose to train the model with a purely intrinsic reward signal to guide exploration, which is based on the impact of the robot's actions on its internal representation of the environment. So far, impact-based rewards have been employed for simple tasks and in procedurally generated synthetic environments with countable states. Since the number of states observable by the agent in realistic indoor environments is non-countable, we include a neural-based density model and replace the traditional count-based regularization with an estimated pseudo-count of previously visited states. The proposed exploration approach outperforms DRL-based competitors relying on intrinsic rewards and surpasses the agents trained with a dense extrinsic reward computed with the environment layouts.

Past works mainly focus on learning-based methods to achieve high precision. However, they have difficulty being generalized for the limitation of specified training models. To break through this drawback of learning-based approaches, we introduce a new perspective of similarity matching between novel objects and a known database based on category-association to achieve pick-and-place tasks with high accuracy and stabilization. We calculate the category name similarity using word embedding to quantify the semantic similarity between the categories of known models and the target real-world objects. With a similar model identified by a similarity prediction function, we preplan a series of robust grasps and imitate them to plan new grasps on the real-world target object. We also propose a distance-based method to infer the in-hand posture of objects and adjust small rotations to achieve stable placements under uncertainty.

Recently, research in computer graphics investigated machine-learning methods for character animation based on training human-like models directly on motion capture data. Such methods proved effective in virtual environments, mainly focusing on trajectory visualization. This letter presents ADHERENT, a system architecture integrating machine-learning methods used in computer graphics with whole-body control methods employed in robotics to generate and stabilize human-like trajectories for humanoid robots. Leveraging human motion capture locomotion data, ADHERENT yields a general footstep planner, including forward, sideways, and backward walking trajectories that blend smoothly from one to another. Furthermore, at the joint configuration level, ADHERENT computes data-driven whole-body postural reference trajectories coherent with the generated footsteps, thus increasing the human likeness of the resulting robot motion. Extensive validations of the proposed architecture are presented with both simulations and real experiments on the iCub humanoid robot, thus demonstrating ADHERENT to be robust to varying step sizes and walking speeds.",ar,2022-04-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Humanoid robot systems | machine learning for robot control | whole-body motion planning and control,2-s2.0-85123304496,,,Article,Viceconte P.M.,60102151;60032350;60025153;60022195;60003771,Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia;Sapienza Università di Roma;Università degli Studi di Genova;Massachusetts Institute of Technology;The University of Manchester,Genoa;Rome;Genoa;Cambridge;Manchester,Italy;Italy;Italy;United States;United Kingdom,9,"Viceconte, Paolo Maria;Camoriano, Raffaello;Romualdi, Giulio;Ferigo, Diego;Dafarra, Stefano;Traversaro, Silvio;Oriolo, Giuseppe;Rosasco, Lorenzo;Pucci, Daniele",57223144875;56085267200;57207202427;57194087376;57193029048;56595278200;7003629456;8423888500;55201907900,60102151-60032350;60102151-60022195;60102151-60025153;60102151-60003771;60102151;60102151;60032350;60102151-60022195-60025153;60102151-60003771,1 April 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,2,,2779-2786,1,,undefined,,3,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3141658

Specifically, we investigate how coherent sets, an environmental feature found in these environments, inform robot awareness within these scenarios. The proposed approach is an online environmental feature generator which can be used for robot reasoning. We compute coherent sets online with techniques from machine learning and design frameworks for robot behavior that leverage coherent set features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of online methods over offline methods. Notably, we apply these online methods for robot monitoring of pedestrian behaviors and robot navigation through water.

10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104431,The role of feedback and guidance as intervention methods to foster computational thinking in educational robotics learning activities for primary school,"Computational thinking (CT) is considered an emerging competence domain linked to 21st-century competences, and educational robotics (ER) is increasingly recognised as a tool to develop CT competences. This is why researchers recommend developing intervention methods adapted to classroom practice and providing explicit guidelines to teachers on integrating ER activities. The present study thus addresses this challenge. Guidance and feedback were considered as critical intervention methods to foster CT competences in ER settings. A between-subjects experiment was conducted with 66 students aged 8 to 9 in the context of a remote collaborative robot programming mission, with four experimental conditions. A two-step strategy was employed to report students' CT competence (their performance and learning process). Firstly, the students' CT learning gains were measured through a pre-post-test design. Secondly, video analysis was used to identify the creative computational problem-solving patterns involved in the experimental condition that had the most favourable impact on the students’ CT scores. Results show that delayed feedback is an effective intervention method for CT development in ER activities. Subject to delayed feedback, students are better at formulating the robot behaviour to be programmed, and, thus, such a strategy reinforces the anticipation process underlying the CT.",ar,2022-04-01,Computers and Education,21st-century abilities | Collaborative learning | Elementary education | Improving classroom teaching | Teaching/learning strategies,2-s2.0-85122614192,S0360131522000021,,Article,Chevalier M.,60110693;60101870;60028186;101404739,Université Côte d'Azur;Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana;Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;Haute École Pédagogique du Canton de Vaud,Nice;Manno;Lausanne;Lausanne,France;Switzerland;Switzerland;Switzerland,10,"Chevalier, Morgane;Giang, Christian;El-Hamamsy, Laila;Bonnet, Evgeniia;Papaspyros, Vaios;Pellet, Jean Philippe;Audrin, Catherine;Romero, Margarida;Baumberger, Bernard;Mondada, Francesco",56038487900;57204360363;57219702090;57191821370;57210558689;23390442300;57193897804;36698221700;6603299372;6603066571,60028186-101404739;60028186-60101870;60028186;60028186;60028186;101404739;101404739;60110693;101404739;60028186,April 2022,03601315,17645,,Journal,180,,104431,,1,SNF,undefined,Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung,14,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104431
10.1109/LRA.2022.3140449,SCVP: Learning One-Shot View Planning via Set Covering for Unknown Object Reconstruction,"The view planning (VP) problem in robotic active vision enables a robot system to automatically perform object reconstruction tasks. Lacking prior knowledge, next-best-view (NBV) methods are typically used to plan a view sequence, with the goal of covering as many object surface areas as possible in an unknown environment. However, such methods have two problems: (1) they are unable to perform global path planning; and (2) the reconstruction process is inefficient because of time-consuming ray casting and high movement cost. We propose a neural network, SCVP, to pre-learn prior knowledge via set covering (SC) based training so as to achieve one-shot view planning. The SCVP network takes the volumetric occupancy grid as input and directly predicts a small (ideally minimum) number of views that cover all surface areas. Given object 3D models as a priori geometric knowledge, the training dataset is automatically labeled by the set covering optimization method. We propose a global path planning method to reconstruct objects without redundant movement. Comparative experiments on multiple datasets of 3D models show that, under the condition of similar or better surface coverage, the proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art NBV methods in terms of movement cost and inference time. Real-world experiments confirm that the proposed method can achieve faster object reconstruction than other methods.",ar,2022-04-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Autonomous agents | Computer vision for automation | Data sets for robotic vision | Deep learning for visual perception | Motion and path planning,2-s2.0-85122594038,,,Article,Pan S.,60009860,Fudan University,Shanghai,China,3,"Pan, Sicong;Hu, Hao;Wei, Hui",57367703200;56217512300;7402516480,60009860;60009860;60009860,1 April 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,2,,1463-1470,0,,undefined,,5,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3140449

DALK has been explored as a potential application of robot microsurgery because the small scales, fine control requirements, and difficulty of visualization make it very challenging for human surgeons to perform. We address the problem of modelling the small scale interactions between the surgical tool and the cornea tissue to improve the accuracy of needle insertion, since accurate placement within 5% of target depth has been associated with more reliable clinical outcomes. We develop a data-driven autoregressive dynamic model of the tool-tissue interaction and a model predictive controller to guide robot needle insertion.

10.1109/LRA.2021.3140127,Manipulation Planning From Demonstration Via Goal-Conditioned Prior Action Primitive Decomposition and Alignment,"Manipulation plays a vital role in robotics but is left unsolved. Recent work attempts to leverage the hierarchical structure of tasks via using action primitives. However, due to trajectory distribution shift, prior action primitives could hardly be adapted to new tasks. In this letter, we propose the layered action primitive planning from demonstration framework (LAPPLAND) to better utilize prior action primitives while maintaining behavior-interpretability. First, we pretrain goal-conditioned action primitives decoupled with a meta policy and an inverse dynamics model to facilitate interpretable goal state and reachable trajectory. Second, we decompose tasks with logical sub-structure into a sequence of prior action primitives and then align them for better adaption. Third, we execute the action primitives in sequence, conditioned on explicitly assigned goals to lead to the desired states. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments validate that robotic manipulation planning using LAPPLAND achieves a high success rate and is robust to the variation of the environment. We also compare LAPPLAND with three state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate its superiority.",ar,2022-04-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Learning from demonstraion | Manipulation planning | Task planning,2-s2.0-85122561023,,,Article,Lin N.,60030835;60025345;60019118,University of Alberta;Guangzhou University;University of Science and Technology of China,Edmonton;Guangzhou;Hefei,Canada;China;China,9,"Lin, Nan;Li, Yuxuan;Tang, Keke;Zhu, Yujun;Zhang, Xiayu;Wang, Ruolin;Ji, Jianmin;Chen, Xiaoping;Zhang, Xinming",57202398822;57221104390;56682442000;57213521106;57433899400;57221093911;34869653800;36536786600;55715219100,60019118;60030835;60025345;60019118;60019118;60019118;60019118;60019118;60019118,1 April 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,2,,1387-1394,0,NSFC,2020A1515110997,National Natural Science Foundation of China,7,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2021.3140127
10.1109/LRA.2021.3139145,Learning Selective Communication for Multi-Agent Path Finding,"Learning communication via deep reinforcement learning (RL) or imitation learning (IL) has recently been shown to be an effective way to solve Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). However, existing communication based MAPF solvers focus on broadcast communication, where an agent broadcasts its message to all other or predefined agents. It is not only impractical but also leads to redundant information that could even impair the multi-agent cooperation. A succinct communication scheme should learn which information is relevant and influential to each agent's decision making process. To address this problem, we consider a request-reply scenario and propose Decision Causal Communication (DCC), a simple yet efficient model to enable agents to select neighbors to conduct communication during both training and execution. Specifically, a neighbor is determined as relevant and influential only when the presence of this neighbor causes the decision adjustment on the central agent. This judgment is learned only based on agent's local observation and thus suitable for decentralized execution to handle large scale problems. Empirical evaluation in obstacle-rich environment indicates the high success rate with low communication overhead of our method.",ar,2022-04-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Motion and path planning | Path planning for multiple mobile robots or agents | Reinforcement learning,2-s2.0-85122290224,,,Article,Ma Z.,60018491;60014171;60006541,Simon Fraser University;University of Waterloo;The University of Hong Kong,Burnaby;Waterloo;Hong Kong,Canada;Canada;Hong Kong,3,"Ma, Ziyuan;Luo, Yudong;Pan, Jia",57225982687;57218213777;35786627600,60018491;60014171;60006541,1 April 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,2,,1455-1462,0,NSFC,61105049,National Natural Science Foundation of China,6,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2021.3139145

We present MotionBenchMaker, an open-source tool to generate benchmarking datasets for realistic robot manipulation problems. MotionBenchMaker is designed to be an extensible, easy-To-use tool that allows users to both generate datasets and benchmark them by comparing motion planning algorithms. Empirically, we show the benefit of using MotionBenchMaker as a tool to procedurally generate datasets which helps in the fair evaluation of planners.

Points of interest (POI) for possible navigation directions are obtained from the environment and an optimal waypoint is selected, based on the available data. Following the waypoints, the robot is guided towards the global goal and the local optimum problem of reactive navigation is mitigated. Then, a motion policy for local navigation is learned through a DRL framework in a simulation. We develop a navigation system where this learned policy is integrated into a motion planning stack as the local navigation layer to move the robot between waypoints towards a global goal. The fully autonomous navigation is performed without any prior knowledge while a map is recorded as the robot moves through the environment.

Programmable robots have become a valuable positive resource in order to succeed in the development of computational thinking, demanding proper training from kindergarten teachers and trainees in order to be able to teach robotic programming. This article has the purpose to 1) identify the frequent errors made by trainee kindergarten teachers when solving a series of robotic problems in a computational thinking module, which develops in the course of Didactics of Mathematics and 2) determine the level of comprehension of the robot concept acquired by the trainees when solving robotics problems. The research developed in a qualitative methodology manner; the data used for this article were collected through the solving of five robotic problems and an open-ended question that had to be answered by each of the 25 participants individually. The results showed that, in general, the most frequent error appeared in problems in which movements were set in a Euclidean space of two dimensions.

These planning problems come up surprisingly frequently, such as in robot manipulation for performing daily life assistive tasks. However, few solutions to constrained motion planning are available, and those that exist struggle with high computational time complexity in finding a path solution on the manifolds. To address this challenge, we present Constrained Motion Planning Networks X (CoMPNetX). It is a neural planning approach, comprising a conditional deep neural generator and discriminator with neural gradients-based fast projection operator. We also introduce neural task and scene representations conditioned on which the CoMPNetX generates implicit manifold configurations to turbo-charge any underlying classical planner such as sampling-based motion planning methods for quickly solving complex constrained planning tasks.

By means of both devices, robot movements are controlled by industrial communication after hand movements, classification and data processing stages. The data processing, control and positioning results of the platform developed in the article are presented in comparison with similar studies in the literature. As a result, it has been observed that the developed platform works with high accuracy. EMG classification success was determined as 96.9% and hand tracking error between 2.45–2.85 mm.

Students worked in a research context, with the aim of making the functions of the NAO robot as social and autonomous as possible, adopting in the design process the Wolfram Language (WL), from the Mathematica software. Interfacing the programming environment of the NAO with Mathematica, they solved in part the problem of autonomy of the NAO, thus realizing enhanced functions of autonomous movement, recognition of human faces and speech for improving the system social interaction. An external repository was created to streamline processes and stow data that the robot can easily access. Self-assessment processes demonstrated that the course provided students with useful skills to cope with real life problems.

10.1145/3517236,Battery-free MakeCode: Accessible Programming for Intermittent Computing,"Hands-on computing has emerged as an exciting and accessible way to learn about computing and engineering in the physical world for students and makers of all ages. Current end-to-end approaches like Microsoft MakeCode require tethered or battery-powered devices like a micro:bit, limiting usefulness and applicability, as well as abdicating responsibility for teaching sustainable practices. Unfortunately, energy harvesting computing devices are usually only programmable by experts and require significant supporting toolchains and knowledge across multiple engineering and computing disciplines to work effectively. This paper bridges the gap between sustainable computing efforts, the maker movement, and novice-focused programming environments with MakeCode-Iceberg, a set of compiler extensions to Microsoft's open-source MakeCode project. The extensions automatically and invisibly transform user code in any language supported (Blocks, JavaScript, Python)into a version that can safely and correctly execute across intermittent power failures caused by unreliable energy harvesting. Determining where, when, and what to save in a checkpoint on limited energy, time, and hardware budget is challenging. We leverage the unique intermediate representation of the MakeCode source-to-source compiler to design and deploy various checkpointing techniques. Our approach allows us to provide, for the first time, a fully web-based and toolchain-free environment to program intermittent computing devices, making battery-free operation accessible to all. We demonstrate new use cases with multiple energy harvesters, peripherals, and application domains: including a Smart Terrarium, Step Counter, and Combination Lock. MakeCode-Iceberg provides sustainable hands-on computing opportunities to a broad audience of makers and learners, democratizing access to energy harvesting and battery-free embedded systems.",ar,2022-03-01,"Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies",Battery-free | Block based programming | Energy Harvesting | Intermittent Computing,2-s2.0-85127889255,,,Article,Kraemer C.,60007363,Northwestern University,Evanston,United States,4,"Kraemer, Christopher;Guo, Amy;Ahmed, Saad;Hester, Josiah",57567022500;57566830000;57192652334;55973287400,60007363;60007363;60007363;60007363,March 2022,,21101020041,24749567,Journal,6,1,18,,0,NSF,CNS-1850496,National Science Foundation,4,2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3517236
10.1109/TCDS.2020.2986411,Intrinsic Motivations and Planning to Explain Tool-Use Development: A Study with a Simulated Robot Model,"Developmental psychology experiments on tool use show that infants' capacity to use a rake-like tool to retrieve a toy arises quite suddenly around 18 months. We use a developmental-robotics model to propose and test two alternative hypotheses to explain this conundrum. Both hypotheses rely on the assumptions that tool use involves goal-directed behavior processes guided by the goal of retrieving the toy, and that 'understanding how to use a tool' means acquiring the capacity to assemble a sequence of actions to accomplish the goal (e.g., to 'hook' and then 'retrieve' the toy). The first hypothesis is that the tool-use ability emerges when the infant develops enough planning capabilities. The second hypothesis is that the ability emerges when the infant's intrinsic motivation system develops and makes playing with a couple of objects interesting enough so that the infant plays with objects similar to the tool at home and thus acquires the actions needed to retrieve the toy in the lab. These hypotheses are tested through a neural-network architecture controlling a simulated humanoid robot tested with the tool-rake task. Given the assumptions made in the model, the results show that both hypotheses can reproduce the average behavior of infants but only the intrinsic-motivation hypothesis can reproduce the sudden tool-use improvement.",ar,2022-03-01,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems,affordances and planning | Affordances and planning | development of tool use | dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) | embodied cognitive development | goal generation and intrinsic motivations (IMs) | neural networks | reinforcement learning | simulated iCub humanoid robot,2-s2.0-85127524282,,,Article,Seepanomwan K.,60123796;60018809;60012572,"Université Paris Cité;Silpakorn University;Istituto Di Scienze E Tecnologie Della Cognizione, Rome",Paris;Nakhon Pathom;Rome,France;Thailand;Italy,4,"Seepanomwan, Kristsana;Caligiore, Daniele;O'Regan, Kevin J.;Baldassarre, Gianluca",55811017200;23092725300;55207447800;57196314496,60018809;60012572;60123796;60012572,1 March 2022,23798920,21100784665,23798939,Journal,14,1,,75-89,1,EC,713010,European Commission,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/TCDS.2020.2986411

This gap is one of the major concerns of the electronics engineering students. Different strategies, such as simulation tools or breadboard implementations, have been followed so far to make it easier for students to practice what they study in lectures. However, many students still claim to have problems when they face real practical implementations. The use of reconfigurable platforms as a teaching tool is proposed to provide the students the possibility of fast experimentation, reducing both development time and the learning curve. In addition, reconfigurable platforms available on the market make this methodology suitable to be applied throughout the different courses of their curricula. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated in a course at the M.Eng. level, where the objective is the study, design and development of electronic sensor nodes. We firmly consider, based on the students’ results and reflections collected during the course, that this methodology helps students to address the theoretical framework from a practical viewpoint, as well as to acquire some of the fundamental skills for their professional careers, such as the usage of communication protocols and embedded systems programming, in a more intuitive way when compared to traditional teaching methodologies.",ar,2022-03-01,Micromachines,education | electronics engineering | programmable platforms | rapid prototyping | reconfigurable electronics | sensors,2-s2.0-85127381894,,,Article,Rivadeneyra A.,60027844;60019722,Universidad de Granada;Technische Universität München,Granada;Munich,Spain;Germany,8,"Rivadeneyra, Almudena;Romero, Francisco J.;Haider, Michael;Bhatt, Vijay D.;Salmeron, Jose F.;Rodriguez, Noel;Morales, Diego P.;Becherer, Markus",6505581823;57139809600;57192206394;56417412500;55072654700;10042233800;18434438000;24314957500,60027844;60027844;60019722;60019722;60019722;60027844;60027844;60019722,March 2022,,21100229176,2072666X,Journal,13,3,442,,1,EC,FPU16/01451,European Commission,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13030442

Q-learning algorithm increases its importance due to its utility in interacting with the environment. However, the size of state space and computational cost are the main parts to be improved. Hence, this paper proposes an improved epsilon-greedy Q-learning (IEGQL) algorithm to enhance efficiency and productivity regarding path length and computational cost. It is important to determine an effective reward function and adjust the agent’s next action to ensure exploitation and exploration. We present a new reward function to ensure the environment’s knowledge in advance for a mobile robot. Additionally, novel mathematical modeling is proposed to provide the optimal selection besides ensuring a rapid convergence. Since a mobile robot has difficulty moving through the path with sharp corners, the smooth path is formed after obtaining the optimal skeleton path. Furthermore, a real-world experiment is given based on the multi-objective function. The benchmark of the proposed IEGQL algorithm with the classical EGQL and A-star algorithms is presented. The experimental results and performance analysis indicate that the IEGQL algorithm generates the optimal path based on path length, computation time, low jerk, and staying closer to the optimal skeleton path.",ar,2022-03-01,Journal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering,Improved epsilon-greedy Q-learning | Mobile robot | Path planning | Quintic trigonometric Bézier curve | Reward function,2-s2.0-85126029739,,,Article,Bulut V.,60104498,İzmir Kâtip Çelebi Üniversitesi,Izmir,Turkey,1,"Bulut, Vahide",56530479100,60104498,March 2022,16785878,71359,18063691,Journal,44,3,106,,0,,undefined,,9,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40430-022-03399-w

The aim of this municipal initiative is to support young children’s understanding of technologies, coding and robotics as an element of twenty-first century skills. Based on video observations, the study provides a situated account of how the children engage in problem-solving in the observed activities. In empirical terms, the study shows how problem-solving tasks, such as programming a robot to move from A to B, merge with complex endeavors of engaging meaningfully with things and people in social situations. These empirical findings are analyzed by employing theoretical conceptualizations of problem-solving from a sociocultural perspective.

In the virtual space, a modified Q-learning algorithm is proposed to solve the path planning problem in product assembly. The proposed algorithm speeds up the convergence speed by adding a dynamic reward function, optimizes the initial Q table by introducing knowledge and experience through the case-based reasoning algorithm, and prevents entry into the trapped area through the obstacle avoiding method. Finally, the six-joint robot UR10 is taken as an example to verify the performance of the algorithm in the three-dimensional pathfinding space.

Students can use the IRobotQ3D software on the computer to build virtual robots and simulation environments, write and debug programs to run the operation of physical robots in the simulation window. The technical route of building simulation design function for each physical robot in a 3D environment was determined, and the four-stage iteration design process was described in detail. Then the steps of applying IRobotQ3D in robotics education were introduced and an experiment was conducted. Forty-four first-year junior high school students participated in the experiment.

10.1002/cae.22464,Model-based automatic grading of object-oriented programming assignments,"Automatic grading of object-oriented programming (OOP) assignments is an important problem from practical, theoretical, and educational viewpoints. Apart from computing a specific grade, an effective grading method needs to provide systematic feedback comments to both the design and code elements. Existing works have proposed grading methods that make various assumptions about the design. However, none of these methods have considered using a design language for the program model. A challenge here is to use a language that eases learning and application in program design. In this paper, we propose a novel grading method, named OOPGRADER, which automatically grades OOP assignments constructed based on an essentially detailed program model. This model is defined in an embedded design language, which directly uses the annotation feature of OOP language to express the essential design rules. We explain how programming assignments can be designed with this language and propose a program checker and a grader for both student and teacher to use in working on the assignments and in grading them. We implement these components in a tool and develop an Eclipse plugin for this tool. We evaluate our method using a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The main result is that our method helps students effectively learn to program through detailed feedback comments based on a program model.

10.1109/TCDS.2019.2962228,Incremental Learning Framework for Autonomous Robots Based on Q-Learning and the Adaptive Kernel Linear Model,"The performance of autonomous robots in varying environments needs to be improved. For such incremental improvement, here we propose an incremental learning framework based on $Q$ -learning and the adaptive kernel linear (AKL) model. The AKL model is used for storing behavioral policies that are learned by $Q$ -learning. Both the structure and parameters of the AKL model can be trained using a novel L2-norm kernel recursive least squares (L2-KRLS) algorithm. The AKL model initially without nodes and gradually accumulates content. The proposed framework allows to learn new behaviors without forgetting the previous ones. A novel local $\varepsilon $ -greedy policy is proposed to speed the convergence rate of $Q$ -learning. It calculates the exploration probability of each state for generating and selecting more important training samples. The performance of our incremental learning framework was validated in two experiments. A curve-fitting example shows that the L2-KRLS-based AKL model is suitable for incremental learning. The second experiment is based on robot learning tasks. The results show that our framework can incrementally learn behaviors in varying environments.

It considers many issues during this process, such as collision avoidance, and robot failure. The proposed approach consists of three parts: a neural dynamic path planner, a hyperbolic tangent path optimizer, and an error-driven path tracker. Assisted by Ultra-wideband positioning system, the proposed MPPTM is a low-cost solution for online path planning and high-accurate tracking of MRS in practical environments. In the proposed MPPTM, the proposed path planner has good time performance, and the proposed path optimizer improves tracking accuracy.

10.18280/isi.270113,Radio Frequency Identification Based Student Attendance System,"Attendance is a record tracking system used in organization. It is used in the educational sector to track students who attend classes as well as staffs attendance. This system is a form of inventory keeping system in school but instead of tracking goods, people are tracked. In Babcock the attendance system being used presently is conventional and very susceptible to attacks. Due to these, a system is created to curb these challenges. In this work an attendance system was created which receives data input from student and staff at any given instance through the help of the RFID tag embedded in the identity card and stores it in a database which the institution can use for tracking attendance. The attendance system created is a mobile application called BrasApp developed using the Java programing language. This application also has a module that tracks attendance of students at hall worship, chapel seminar and church service which forms their citizenship grade. A virtual ticket generation module is included in the BrasApp which helps the cafeteria staff reduce waste of resources and queue during meal time.

Increased emphasis on K-12 engineering education calls for the design of learning environments and curricula that increase interest and conceptual understanding of engineering work, beginning in the early years of childhood. We seek to under-stand what works, for whom, in what contexts, how it works, and how engineering curricula can be improved to promote social justice. Here, we evaluate the impact of a curricular intervention designed to promote equity in elementary engineering education. The integrated STEM curriculum unit engages first-grade students in programming a cookie-jar alarm. Using a KIBO robot, students program a distance sensor to trigger the alarm and customize the sounds and flashing lights. Students’ pre-/post-drawings of ‘engineers at work’ were used to elicit reflection in semi-structured interviews, and to assess changes in students’ conceptions of engineering work following the curricular interven-tion. A mixed analysis of the data revealed students’ conceptual understanding of engineering work improved following the two-week curricular intervention, regardless of gender. However, the girls in the study were more likely than boys to identify as an engineer following the programming design task. We discuss the students’ self-reported explanations and elements of the intervention that may have facilitated conceptual change. We recommend that, to promote equity in engineering education, “gender-responsive” curricula are essential.",ar,2022-02-01,Education Sciences,Early childhood | Engineering | Gender differences | Robotics | STEM,2-s2.0-85124567164,,,Article,Mitchell A.,60031706,Utah State University,Logan,United States,3,"Mitchell, April;Lott, Kimberly H.;Tofel-Grehl, Colby",57450242000;25626764700;55843509900,60031706;60031706;60031706,February 2022,,21100897500,22277102,Journal,12,2,110,,1,,undefined,,3,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci12020110

Automatic peeling of glass substrates of LCD flat panel displays is a typical contact-rich manipulation task, which requires extremely high safe handling through the manipulation process. To this end of peeling glass substrates automatically, the system model is established from data and is used for the online planning of the robot motion in this paper. A simulation environment is designed to pretrain the process model with deep learning-based neural network structure to avoid expensive and time-consuming collection of real-time data. Then, an online learning algorithm is introduced to tune the pretrained model according to the real-time data from the peeling process experiments to cover the uncertainties of the real process. Finally, an Online Learning Model Predictive Path Integral (OL-MPPI) algorithm is proposed for the optimal trajectory planning of the robot.

FPGAs possess the advantages of low latency and high energy efficiency, but the scarcity of FPGA development resources challenges the deployment of DNN‐based edge devices. Register‐transfer level programming, hardware verification, and pre-cise resource allocation are needed to build a high‐performance FPGA accelerator for DNNs. These tasks present a challenge and are time consuming for even experienced hardware developers. There-fore, we propose an automated, collaborative design process employing an automatic design space exploration tool; an automatic DNN engine enables the tool to reshape and parse a DNN model from software to hardware. We also introduce a long short‐term memory (LSTM)‐based model to predict performance and generate a DNN model that suits the developer requirements automati-cally.

10.1007/s10514-021-10029-2,Decentralized probabilistic multi-robot collision avoidance using buffered uncertainty-aware Voronoi cells,"In this paper, we present a decentralized and communication-free collision avoidance approach for multi-robot systems that accounts for both robot localization and sensing uncertainties. The approach relies on the computation of an uncertainty-aware safe region for each robot to navigate among other robots and static obstacles in the environment, under the assumption of Gaussian-distributed uncertainty. In particular, at each time step, we construct a chance-constrained buffered uncertainty-aware Voronoi cell (B-UAVC) for each robot given a specified collision probability threshold. Probabilistic collision avoidance is achieved by constraining the motion of each robot to be within its corresponding B-UAVC, i.e. the collision probability between the robots and obstacles remains below the specified threshold. The proposed approach is decentralized, communication-free, scalable with the number of robots and robust to robots’ localization and sensing uncertainties. We applied the approach to single-integrator, double-integrator, differential-drive robots, and robots with general nonlinear dynamics. Extensive simulations and experiments with a team of ground vehicles, quadrotors, and heterogeneous robot teams are performed to analyze and validate the proposed approach.",ar,2022-02-01,Autonomous Robots,Collision avoidance | Motion planning | Multi-robot systems | Planning under uncertainty,2-s2.0-85123483318,,,Article,Zhu H.,60118240,"Department of Cognitive Robotics, TU Delft",Delft,Netherlands,3,"Zhu, Hai;Brito, Bruno;Alonso-Mora, Javier",57205189246;57211022915;37057150200,60118240;60118240;60118240,February 2022,09295593,18016,15737527,Journal,46,2,,401-420,0,ONRG,15916,Office of Naval Research Global,9,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10514-021-10029-2

10.3390/s22030941,An Experimental Safety Response Mechanism for an Autonomous Moving Robot in a Smart Manufacturing Environment Using Q-Learning Algorithm and Speech Recognition,"The industrial manufacturing sector is undergoing a tremendous revolution moving from traditional production processes to intelligent techniques. Under this revolution, known as Industry 4.0 (I40), a robot is no longer static equipment but an active workforce to the factory production alongside human operators. Safety becomes crucial for humans and robots to ensure a smooth production run in such environments. The loss of operating moving robots in plant evacuation can be avoided with the adequate safety induction for them. Operators are subject to frequent safety inductions to react in emergencies, but very little is done for robots. Our research proposes an experimental safety response mechanism for a small manufacturing plant, through which an autonomous robot learns the obstacle-free trajectory to the closest safety exit in emergencies. We implement a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, Q-learning, to enable the path learning abilities of the robot. After obtaining the robot optimal path selection options with Q-learning, we code the outcome as a rule-based system for the safety response. We also program a speech recognition system for operators to react timeously, with a voice command, to an emergency that requires stopping all plant activities even when they are far away from the emergency stops (ESTOPs) button. An ESTOP or a voice command sent directly to the factory central controller can give the factory an emergency signal. We tested this functionality on real hardware from an S7-1200 Siemens programmable logic controller (PLC). We simulate a simple and small manufacturing environment overview to test our safety procedure. Our results show that the safety response mechanism successfully generates paths without obstacles to the closest safety exits from all the factory locations. Our research benefits any manufacturing SME intending to implement the initial and primary use of autonomous moving robots (AMR) in their factories. It also impacts manufacturing SMEs using legacy devices such as traditional PLCs by offering them intelligent strategies to incorporate current state-of-the-art technologies such as speech recognition to improve their performances. Our research empowers SMEs to adopt advanced and innovative technological concepts within their operations.",ar,2022-02-01,Sensors,Autonomous moving robot | Obstacle-free path planning | Q-learning algorithm | Reinforcement learning (RL) | Safety response | Smart manufacturing | Speech recognition,2-s2.0-85123351962,,35161688,Article,Kiangala K.S.,60002397,University of South Africa,Pretoria,South Africa,2,"Kiangala, Kahiomba Sonia;Wang, Zenghui",57202162378;7410034341,60002397;60002397,February-1 2022,14248220,130124,,Journal,22,3,941,,1,NRF,112108,National Research Foundation,4,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22030941

This greatly limits the application of binocular vision for robotic arm guidance. Traditional stereo matching algorithms suffer from disparity loss, dilation and other problems, and deep learning algorithms have weakly generalization ability, making high-accuracy results impossible with non-training images. We propose an algorithm that uses segments and edges as matching units. We find the mapping relationship between two-dimensional images and three-dimensional scenes using segments. The algorithm obtains highly accurate results in industrial robotic applications with mainly planar facets. We combine it with a deep learning algorithm to obtain very good high-accuracy results in both general scenes and applications of industrial robots. The algorithm effectively improves the non-linear optimization ability of traditional algorithms and generalization ability of deep learning, and provides an effective method for the binocular vision guidance of industrial robotic scenes. We used the algorithm to guide the robot arm for threading with a success rate of 70%.",ar,2022-02-01,Computer Graphics Forum,binocular vision | industrial robot | stereo matching,2-s2.0-85122296740,,,Article,Wei H.,60009860,Fudan University,Shanghai,China,2,"Wei, Hui;Meng, Lingjiang",7402516480;57397787400,60009860;60009860,February 2022,01677055,25023,14678659,Journal,41,1,,288-300,0,NSFC,2017YFC1703303,National Natural Science Foundation of China,2,2022,https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.14435

Multirobot operations can benefit from this flexibility by actively managing system redundancies depending on current tasks and having more options to respond to failure events. To support this active exploitation of redundancies in robotic systems, this article details an organization model as basis for planning with reconfigurable multirobot systems. The model allows us to exploit redundancies when optimizing a multirobot system's probability of survival with respect to a desired mission. The resulting planning approach trades safety against efficiency in robotic operations and thereby offers a new perspective and tool to design and improve multirobot missions. We use a simulated multirobot planetary exploration mission to evaluate this approach and highlight an exemplary performance landscape.

This paper presents a method for optimizing the trajectory of the mobile robot based on the digital twin of the robot. The digital twin of the mobile robot is created by Unity, and the trajectory of the mobile robot is trained in the virtual environment and applied to the physical space. The simulation training in the virtual environment provides schemes for the actual movement of the robot. Based on the actual movement data returned by the physical robot, the preset trajectory of the virtual robot is dynamically adjusted, which in turn enables the correction of the movement trajectory of the physical robot. The contribution of this work is the use of genetic algorithms for path planning of robots, which enables trajectory optimization of mobile robots by reducing the error in the movement trajectory of physical robots through the interaction of virtual and real data.

Especially in the era of artificial intelligence, the combination of human-machineassisted education teaching has become an optional and efficient teaching mode. As a teaching tool for the transformation of teaching methods empowered by artificial intelligence technology, educational robots have consistent influences on the learning effect of learners, which is the focus of educational technology. As the leading or auxiliary teaching, educational robots can meet the various educational needs of different groups of people and improve the learning performance of learners. This study conducts experimental research on learners majoring in computer science and explores the influences of educational robot-assisted teaching (the experimental group) and traditional classroom teaching (control group) on the learning performance of learners in C language programming.

10.1613/JAIR.1.13754,DeepSym: Deep Symbol Generation and Rule Learning for Planning from Unsupervised Robot Interaction,"Symbolic planning and reasoning are powerful tools for robots tackling complex tasks. However, the need to manually design the symbols restrict their applicability, especially for robots that are expected to act in open-ended environments. Therefore symbol formation and rule extraction should be considered part of robot learning, which, when done properly, will offer scalability, flexibility, and robustness. Towards this goal, we propose a novel general method that finds action-grounded, discrete object and effect categories and builds probabilistic rules over them for non-trivial action planning. Our robot interacts with objects using an initial action repertoire that is assumed to be acquired earlier and observes the effects it can create in the environment. To form action-grounded object, effect, and relational categories, we employ a binary bottleneck layer in a predictive, deep encoder-decoder network that takes the image of the scene and the action applied as input, and generates the resulting effects in the scene in pixel coordinates. After learning, the binary latent vector represents action-driven object categories based on the interaction experience of the robot. To distill the knowledge represented by the neural network into rules useful for symbolic reasoning, a decision tree is trained to reproduce its decoder function. Probabilistic rules are extracted from the decision paths of the tree and are represented in the Probabilistic Planning Domain Definition Language (PPDDL), allowing off-the-shelf planners to operate on the knowledge extracted from the sensorimotor experience of the robot. The deployment of the proposed approach for a simulated robotic manipulator enabled the discovery of discrete representations of object properties such as 'rollable' and 'insertable'. In turn, the use of these representations as symbols allowed the generation of effective plans for achieving goals, such as building towers of the desired height, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach for multi-step object manipulation. Finally, we demonstrate that the system is not only restricted to the robotics domain by assessing its applicability to the MNIST 8-puzzle domain in which learned symbols allow for the generation of plans that move the empty tile into any given position.",ar,2022-01-01,Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research,,2-s2.0-85147540666,,,Article,Ahmetoglu A.,60086558;60024322;60009999;60005803,Ozyegin University;Osaka University;Universität Innsbruck;Boğaziçi Üniversitesi,Istanbul;Suita;Innsbruck;Bebek,Turkey;Japan;Austria;Turkey,5,"Ahmetoglu, Alper;Seker, M.

10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3232130,Local and Global Search-Based Planning for Object Rearrangement in Clutter,"We propose two algorithms based on local and global searches for a Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) problem, which considers a robotic manipulator to rearrange obstacles and grasp a target in clutter. In the problem, no collision-free path for a robotic manipulator is available unless some obstacles blocking a target are relocated. The two algorithms determine the sequence of obstacles to be removed for grasping a target without collisions. The local search algorithm determines the sequence quickly in an online manner but could be suboptimal in the number of removed obstacles. The global search algorithm based on tree search needs upfront computation but runs in polynomial time. In numerical simulation settings, we consider objects in various shapes, which could make reachable directions bounded. From the simulations the planning time of local search algorithm is faster than that of global search, whereas the global search algorithm removes the less number of obstacles than the local search. In addition, we show that the global search algorithm with a heuristic cost is faster than without the cost but the minimum number of removed obstacles is still obtained from the global search algorithm without the heuristic cost.

We apply both rule-based and learning-based navigation policies using the traversability map. Running sensor data processing and other autonomous driving components simultaneously, our navigation policies perform rapidly at a refresh rate of 18 Hz for control command, whereas other systems have slower refresh rates.

10.1109/TASE.2022.3215562,NR-RRT: Neural Risk-Aware Near-Optimal Path Planning in Uncertain Nonconvex Environments,"Balancing the trade-off between safety and efficiency is of significant importance for path planning under uncertainty. Many developed risk-aware path planners explicitly limit the probability of collision to an acceptable bound in uncertain environments. However, convex obstacles or Gaussian uncertainties are usually assumed to make the problem tractable in the existing method. These assumptions limit the generalization and application of path planners in real-world implementations. In this article, we propose to apply deep learning methods to the sampling-based planner, developing a novel risk bounded near-optimal path planning algorithm named neural risk-aware RRT (NR-RRT). Specifically, a deterministic risk contours map is maintained by perceiving the probabilistic nonconvex obstacles, and a neural network sampler is proposed to predict the next most-promising safe state. Furthermore, the recursive divide-and-conquer planning and bidirectional search strategies are used to accelerate the convergence to a near-optimal solution with guaranteed bounded risk. Worst-case theoretical guarantees can also be proven owing to a standby safety guaranteed planner utilizing a uniform sampling distribution. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art for finding risk bounded low-cost paths in uncertain nonconvex environments with seen and unseen scene layouts. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;This article is motivated by developing an efficient risk-aware path planner that can quickly find risk bounded solutions in uncertain nonconvex environments for practical applications, such as autonomous vehicles and search-and-rescue robots. Sampling-based planning approaches such as rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) and its variants are popular for their good performance in exploring the state space. However, it is quite time-consuming to look for risk bounded paths in uncertain environments, especially under nonconvex and non-Gaussian constraints. The initial paths are often of poor quality. Therefore, we propose the NR-RRT algorithm to rapidly find near-optimal solutions with guaranteed bounded risk. It utilizes an informed bidirectional search strategy after having past experiences in the challenging environments.

To take advantage of forage resources and improve land productivity, we require knowledge of pastureland growth patterns that is simply unavailable at the state of the art. In this paper, we propose to deploy a team of robots to monitor the evolution of an unknown pastureland environment to fulfill the above goal. To monitor such an environment, which usually evolves slowly, we need to design a strategy for rapid assessment of the environment over large areas at a low cost. Thus, we propose an integrated pipeline comprising data synthesis, deep neural network training, and prediction along with a multi-robot deployment algorithm that monitors pasturelands intermittently. Specifically, using expert-informed agricultural data coupled with novel data synthesis in ROS Gazebo, we first propose a new neural network architecture to learn the spatiotemporal dynamics of the environment. Such predictions help us to understand pastureland growth patterns on large scales and make appropriate monitoring decisions for the future. Based on our predictions, we then design an intermittent multi-robot deployment policy for low-cost monitoring. Finally, we compare the proposed pipeline with other methods, from data synthesis to prediction and planning, to corroborate our pipeline&#x2019;s performance. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;Pasturelands are an integral part of agricultural production in the United States.

The heuristic search algorithm is analyzed and introduced, and A is chosen. A two-dimensional spatial environment model of picking robot path planning is investigated, and a spatial model of picking robot path planning is established by raster method. Then, considering the whole day operation time, the whole day operation time is divided into several periods. With the help of heuristic search algorithm, the most reasonable operation time interval of each period is found, so as to provide reliable reference for the decision-making organization of urban rail transit operation on how to arrange the train rationally. The experimental results show that the improved A∗ algorithm can significantly improve the moving path of the picking robot and make the planned path smoother, which confirms the feasibility and superiority of the improved algorithm. The operation decision of urban rail transit is obtained through experiments.

The method expands upon an existing deterministic deep-meta learning model that, in contrast, only provided single-point energy estimates. The performance of the proposed method is compared against the deterministic approach in a 3D-body dynamic simulator over several typologies of deformable terrains and unstructured geometries.

Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that has increased in popularity in mobile robot path planning in recent times, due to its self-learning capability without requiring a priori model of the environment. However, Q-learning shows slow convergence to the optimal solution, notwithstanding such an advantage. To address this limitation, the concept of partially guided Q-learning is employed wherein, the artificial potential field (APF) method is utilized to improve the classical Q-learning approach. Therefore, the proposed QAPF learning algorithm for path planning can enhance learning speed and improve final performance using the combination of Q-learning and the APF method.

In our present work, we investigate different user feedback types to teach a real robot a new movement skill. We compare feedback as star ratings on an absolute scale for single roll-outs versus preference-based feedback for pairwise comparisons with respective optimization algorithms (i.e., a variation of co-variance matrix adaptation -evolution strategy (CMA-ES) and random optimization) to teach the robot the game of skill cup-and-ball. In an experimental investigation with users, we investigated the influence of the feedback type on the user experience of interacting with the different interfaces and the performance of the learning systems. While there is no significant difference for the subjective user experience between the conditions, there is a significant difference in learning performance. The preference-based system learned the task quicker, but this did not influence the users&#x2019; evaluation of it.

Some of these tasks include nonprehensile manipulation performed without grasping objects. Nonprehensile manipulation is very difficult because it requires considering the dynamics of environments and objects. Therefore imitating complex behaviors requires a large number of human demonstrations. In this study, a self-supervised learning that considers dynamics to achieve variable speed for nonprehensile manipulation is proposed. The proposed method collects and fine-tunes only successful action data obtained during autonomous operations. By fine-tuning the successful data, the robot learns the dynamics among itself, its environment, and objects. We experimented with the task of scooping and transporting pancakes using the neural network model trained on 24 human-collected training data. The proposed method significantly improved the success rate from 40.2% to 85.7%, and succeeded the task more than 75% for other objects.",ar,2022-01-01,IEEE Access,Bilateral control | imitation learning | machine learning | motion planning | nonprehensile manipulation | self-supervised learning,2-s2.0-85133700376,,,Article,Saigusa Y.,60028263;60014256,Saitama University;University of Tsukuba,Saitama;Tsukuba,Japan;Japan,3,"Saigusa, Yuki;Sakaino, Sho;Tsuji, Toshiaki",57222289435;20434698200;9332772500,60014256;60014256;60028263,2022,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,10,,,68291-68306,1,KAKEN,21H01347,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3185651
10.1142/S0218126622502589,Mobile Robot Path Planning Method Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm,"Path planning is an important part of the research field of mobile robots, and it is the premise for mobile robots to complete complex tasks. This paper proposes a reflective reward design method based on potential energy function, and combines the ideas of multi-agent and multi-task learning to form a new training framework. The reflective reward represents the quality of the agent's current decision relative to the past historical decision sequence, using the second-order information of the historical reward sequence. The policy or value function update of the master agent is then assisted by the reflective agent. The method proposed in this paper can easily extend the existing deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on value function and policy gradient, and then form a new learning method, so that the agent has the reflective characteristics in human learning after making full use of the reward information. It is good at distinguishing the optimal action in the corresponding state. Experiments in pathfinding scenarios verify the effectiveness of the algorithm in sparse reward scenarios. Compared with other algorithms, the deep reinforcement learning algorithm has higher exploration success rate and stability. Experiments in survival scenarios verify the improvement effect of the reward feature enhancement method based on the auxiliary task learning mechanism on the original algorithm. Simulation experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for solving the path planning problem of mobile robots in dynamic environments and the superiority of deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The simulation results show that the algorithm can accurately avoid unknown obstacles and reach the target point, and the planned path is the shortest and the energy consumed by the robot is the least.

Classical path planning algorithms, such as wavefront and rapidly exploring random tree, are used heavily in autonomous robots. With the recent advances in machine learning, development of learning-based path planning algorithms has been experiencing a rapid growth. A unified path planning interface that facilitates the development and benchmarking of existing and new algorithms is needed. This paper presents PathBench, a platform for developing, visualizing, training, testing, and benchmarking of existing and future, classical and learning-based path planning algorithms in 2D and 3D grid world environments. Many existing path planning algorithms are supported, e.g. A*, Dijkstra, waypoint planning networks, value iteration networks, and gated path planning networks; integrating new algorithms is easy and clearly specified. The benchmarking ability of PathBench is explored in this paper by comparing algorithms across five different hardware systems and three different map types, including built-in PathBench maps, video game maps, and maps from real world databases. Metrics, such as path length, success rate, and computational time, were used to evaluate algorithms.

Among them, the wheel-legged rover has outstanding performance. In order to fully utilize the rover’s capabilities and improve the autonomy in planetary exploration, this paper addresses a plane-based grid (PBG) mapping method for its motion planning in unstructured terrain environments. First, the kinematics of the TAWL rover and each leg’s dynamic are presented to analyze the physical characteristics. Second, the PBG map is constructed based on the rover’s capabilities. It can be directly used during motion planning. This mapping framework utilizes a sensor model to predict whether the grid is occupied or free. Then, a plane cluster algorithm is proposed to classify grid cells, which incorporates two machine learning algorithms. Thus, the flat areas are clustered from the unstructured terrains. With the PBG map and the motion planning framework, the wheel-legged rover can simplify the motion planning process and better utilize the driving efficiency and the legs’ adaptability.

We use multiple sub-agents of M-A3C algorithm to train multiple virtual robots independently at the same time in the physical simulation platform. Then we transfer the trained model to the walking control of the actual robot to reduce the number of training on the actual robot, improve the training speed, and ensure the acquisition of the final gait.

For the slow convergence, this paper 1) modifies the discount rate, learning rate and other parameters to promote the accuracy of value up-dating; 2) introduces single-chain backtracking algorithm to improve the learning speed of agent; 3) designs Q-learning algorithm based on single-chain set to solve the invalid state loops in single-chain; 4) combines the artificial potential field method and the shared single-chain library to enhance the target guidance in the environment exploration of the agent.

However, some teachers are unmotivated due to preconceptions about their difficulties, which hinder their learning and subsequent application in the classroom. This study aims to determine the perception of 195 teachers teaching different grade levels and areas of knowledge on the learning of programming, robotics, and their possibilities of applying them in the classroom. The results show no differences according to the educational stage to perceive adequate skills to learn programming and robotics, although, by area, the teachers of STEAM are considered more capable than the rest. Regarding the introduction of these resources in the classroom, there are no differences according to educational stage. As for differences by area, STEAM teachers stand out, followed by generalist teachers at lower levels (kindergarten and basic school), while there is greater reluctance among teachers of non-STEM areas at higher levels (high school and university and others).

Spatial ability in kindergarten predicts achievement in reading, math, science, and technology in primary school and therefore constitutes an important skill set in preparation for school entrance. Good spatial thinking skills are required for learning in school. The study’s purpose was to examine the contribution of robot programming to an intervention aimed at promoting spatial language (spatial vocabulary) and spatial ability (mental rotation, visual-spatial memory) among preschool children at risk for Specific learning disability (SLD). The sample of 84 preschool children participating in the study was randomly assigned to three groups: (1) intervention group with robot programming, (2) intervention group without robot programming, and (3) a control group. The findings indicate that children exposed to the robot-based intervention exhibited the greatest improvement in spatial vocabulary and mental rotation tests when compared to the children who participated in either the intervention without robot programming or in the control group. No significant differences between the groups were found in post-intervention visual-spatial memory.

10.32604/cmc.2022.028165,Improved Dijkstra Algorithm for Mobile Robot Path Planning and Obstacle Avoidance,"Optimal path planning avoiding obstacles is among the most attractive applications of mobile robots (MRs) in both research and education. In this paper, an optimal collision-free algorithm is designed and implemented practically based on an improved Dijkstra algorithm. To achieve this research objectives, first, the MR obstacle-free environment is modeled as a diagraph including nodes, edges and weights. Second, Dijkstra algorithm is used offline to generate the shortest path driving the MR from a starting point to a target point. During its movement, the robot should follow the previously obtained path and stop at each node to test if there is an obstacle between the current node and the immediately following node. For this aim, the MR was equipped with an ultrasonic sensor used as obstacle detector. If an obstacle is found, the MR updates its diagraph by excluding the corresponding node. Then, Dijkstra algorithm runs on the modified diagraph. This procedure is repeated until reaching the target point. To verify the efficiency of the proposed approach, a simulation was carried out on a hand-made MR and an environment including 9 nodes, 19 edges and 2 obstacles. The obtained optimal path avoiding obstacles has been transferred into motion control and implemented practically using line tracking sensors. This study has shown that the improved Dijkstra algorithm can efficiently solve optimal path planning in environments including obstacles and that STEAM-based MRs are efficient cost-effective tools to practically implement the designed algorithm.",ar,2022-01-01,"Computers, Materials and Continua",improved dijkstra algorithm | Mobile robot (MR) | obstacle avoidance | path planning | STEAM,2-s2.0-85128689991,,,Article,Alshammrei S.,60108699;60104671;60060060,University of Jeddah;University of Ha'il;Ecole Nationale d'Ingenieurs de Monastir,Jeddah;Hail;Monastir,Saudi Arabia;Saudi Arabia;Tunisia,3,"Alshammrei, Shaher;Boubaker, Sahbi;Kolsi, Lioua",57200327510;36545771900;16309887800,60104671;60108699;60104671-60060060,2022,15462218,24364,15462226,Journal,72,3,,5939-5954,1,,undefined,,10,2022,https://doi.org/10.32604/cmc.2022.028165

In the process of research on heterogeneous multicore processor systems, system task scheduling is particularly important. A good task scheduling algorithm can give full play to system performance. In this paper, the intelligent approximation algorithm is applied to the task scheduling problem of heterogeneous multicore processor system, and the heterogeneous multicore processor system is obtained as a highlight in the multicore processor system. Relying on the characteristics of high efficiency and low cost, it is widely loved by people, and at the same time, it has become the most commonly used processor system in embedded systems. In the process of research on heterogeneous multicore processor systems, the system task scheduling problem is particularly important. A good task scheduling algorithm can give full play to system performance. Some commonly used heuristic task scheduling algorithms are insufficient in solving such problems. This paper combines the granularity-based wavefront parallel decoding algorithm and the fast fusion loop filter algorithm to apply pipeline parallel technology between pixels. Decoding reconstruction module and fast loop filter module realize the fusion of multilevel parallel decoding. Based on the multicore platform, a dynamic multiparallel scheduling algorithm is designed to realize two-way video real-time parallel high-speed decoding, which improves the core resource utilization rate and decoding execution efficiency of the multicore processing platform. This paper also designs an indicator collector, a read-write hit collector, and a cache block priority determiner to implement a dynamic generation strategy with low hardware overhead. Multimodal teaching has certain feasibility and effectiveness and can have a positive impact on the English reading motivation and English reading comprehension ability of university students. Multimodal teaching improves students' English reading comprehension ability, deepens students' understanding and memory of words, and broadens the scope of knowledge, which has a significant promoting effect. The research results show that multimodality can be applied to college English teaching, and it can achieve better results than traditional teaching methods. By comparing the test results before and after the test, there are obvious differences between the experimental class and the control class. Whether it is the paired sample T-test of the experimental class or the independent sample T-test of two teaching methods in two classes, it proves that the scores under the multimodal English teaching mode are higher than the traditional teaching mode. Multimodal classrooms provide students with many opportunities to participate in classroom activities and form a competitive learning atmosphere. This competitive learning atmosphere has become a driving force to promote student learning. Multimodal teaching methods help to cultivate students' independent and cooperative learning. In a multimodal classroom, many activities require cooperation and discussion among students. When they encounter difficulties, they can help each other, discuss with each other, and cooperate to complete tasks. Therefore, the multimodal teaching method will stimulate students' interest in learning, give full play to students' initiative, and improve students' English ability.",ar,2022-01-01,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,,2-s2.0-85127717985,,,Article,Huang Y.,60261355,Chengdu College of Arts and Sciences,Chengdu,China,2,"Huang, Yue;Shu, Zheng",57563917500;57563664200,60261355;60261355,2022,1024123X,13082,15635147,Journal,2022,,5774479,,1,,undefined,,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/5774479

Three major classes of Learning Classifier Systems - Anticipatory Classifier System (ACS), ACS2, Yet Another Classifier System (YACS), alongside the traditional Dyna-Q algorithm implementations were adapted to handle real-valued input signal discretization. Aspects like the ability to capture all possible interactions, model generalization capabilities, size of the solution of relative execution times were compared in four different problems using probabilistic modelling, providing unbiased judgments. Results proved that the examined ALCS are capable of solving selected problems.

Computational Thinking (CT) is a new digital literacy that is gradually being introduced in the school curriculum due to its applicability in the daily problem-solving process. Educational Robotics (ER) has been increasingly used as a pedagogical tool to attract students to learn computer programming, and when integrated with CT, they can be used to develop high order thinking skills. However, intertwining between CT and ER remains a challenge for teachers. This paper describes a method to expose secondary school children to CT concepts and skills through ER learning activities. The method integrates the four CT core concepts, which are problem analysis and algorithm; abstraction; pattern recognition; and decomposition, in a two days’ ER workshop implementation. The result of the study shows that the method of integrating CT with ER has the potential to nurture students’ CT and programming skills.

In this regard, learning-based motion generations are currently being investigated. However, the main issue has been improvements of the adaptability to spatially varying environments, but a variation of the operating speed has not been investigated in detail. In contact-rich tasks, it is especially important to be able to adjust the operating speed because a nonlinear relationship occurs between the operating speed and force (e.g., inertial and frictional forces), and it affects the results of the tasks. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method for generating variable operating speeds while adapting to spatial perturbations in the environment. The proposed method can be adapted to nonlinearities by utilizing a small amount of motion data. We experimentally evaluated the proposed method by erasing a line using an eraser fixed to the tip of the robot as an example of a contact-rich task. Furthermore, the proposed method enables a robot to perform a task faster than a human operator and is capable of operating close to the control bandwidth.",ar,2022-01-01,IEEE Open Journal of the Industrial Electronics Society,bilateral control | fast-forward | Imitation learning | machine learning | motion planning,2-s2.0-85124720247,,,Article,Sakaino S.,60028263;60014256,Saitama University;University of Tsukuba,Saitama;Tsukuba,Japan;Japan,4,"Sakaino, Sho;Fujimoto, Kazuki;Saigusa, Yuki;Tsuji, Toshiaki",20434698200;57207823519;57222289435;9332772500,60014256;60028263;60014256;60028263,2022,,21101068036,26441284,Journal,3,,,116-127,1,,undefined,,3,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/OJIES.2022.3149333

The design of the corresponding models is difficult because of their complexity. Multi-agent systems cope with this problem by a divide-and-conquer approach. However, agent model design is still quite a challenge. In this paper, we propose a layered architecture for agents where each component is a kind of a stack-based state machine of our own. This model complements extended finite-state machines with some basic state stack operations that enable not only dealing with hierarchy but also with planning, which is a key element for belief-desire-intention (BDI) agents. Special care was taken to make the representation of these extended finite-state stack machines (EFS2M) simple so that their programming is straightforward. Through an educational example we show how such class of models are, and the potentiality of the solution. The taxi fleet simulation model is a metaphor for transportation systems in structured environments like factories or warehouses but can also be used as a vehicle traffic simulator. As for the latter case, we illustrate how it can be used to determine the efficiency and the quality of service of a taxi fleet in an urban area.",ar,2022-01-01,Multimedia Tools and Applications,Autonomous mobile robots | BDI agents | Cooperating robots | Finite-state stack machines | MAS | State-based modelling | Traffic simulation,2-s2.0-85123126052,,,Article,Ribas-Xirgo L.,60023020,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,Cerdanyola del Valles,Spain,1,"Ribas-Xirgo, Lluís",6507245298,60023020,January 2022,13807501,25627,15737721,Journal,81,3,,3515-3534,0,,undefined,,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-021-11607-3

This approach considers situations in which there are obstacles that only pose a risk to the robots involved in the transport and not necessarily to the group of robots with the load. Thus, we propose to separate the workspace into two layers in a way that the obstacles which only pose risk of collision to the robots can be transposed by a local planner. This new approach to the load transportation problem allows the system to find shorter paths or even find a solution in situations which would not be possible with the classic approach. Furthermore, the developed method has a configuration space independent of the number of robots and it is robust to environmental variation, not reducing its performance in more complex environments as in narrow passages or long corridors.

However, during applications in the real world, robot needs to overcome the effects of a complex working environment with different types of target objects, so it is more difficult to maintain the quality of action planning, even in the same scene. In order to make an agent have the ability to plan actions in a more adaptive way, the deep attentive deterministic policy gradient algorithm is applied in this article. An attention region proposal network is used to select the message of the pre-exploration area. Then this message is calculated using the adaptive exploration method to regulate the strategy as the target changes. Furthermore, a stratified reward function, which is used to reduce the negative influence of miscellaneous information brought by the sparse reward matrix, is defined according to the distance between the end effector and the center of the pre-exploration area.

10.1109/LRA.2021.3118078,A Hierarchical Approach for Mobile Robot Exploration in Pedestrian Crowd,"Autonomous exploration is a fundamental task for mobile robots. However, a major limitation is that in practical applications, robots usually face dynamic obstacles such as pedestrian crowds. These dynamic objects create significant challenges for both collision-free navigation and accurate localization/mapping, which can compromise the safety and exploration performance of the robot. In this work, a hierarchical approach is proposed for both effective exploration and collision-free navigation in crowded environments. The central idea of our approach is to combine local and global information to ensure the safety and efficiency of the exploration planner. Besides, our planning method utilizes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based obstacle avoidance algorithm that allows the robot to safely follow the exploration planner's path through the pedestrian crowd. The proposed system is thoroughly evaluated in simulation environments, and the results show that it outperforms existing methods in terms of not only the exploration efficiency but also the localization and mapping accuracy.",ar,2022-01-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,collision avoidance | Motion and path planning,2-s2.0-85118877521,,,Article,Zheng Z.,60104841;60013983;60006541,The Robotics Institute;City University of Hong Kong;The University of Hong Kong,Pittsburgh;Hong Kong;Hong Kong,United States;Hong Kong;Hong Kong,3,"Zheng, Zhuoqi;Cao, Chao;Pan, Jia",57200627629;57210796576;35786627600,60013983-60006541;60104841;60006541,1 January 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,1,,175-182,0,GRF,11202119,Glaucoma Research Foundation,4,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2021.3118078
10.1109/LRA.2021.3125047,Learning Risk-Aware Costmaps for Traversability in Challenging Environments,"One of the main challenges in autonomous robotic exploration and navigation in unknown and unstructured environments is determining where the robot can or cannot safely move. A significant source of difficulty in this determination arises from stochasticity and uncertainty, coming from localization error, sensor sparsity and noise, difficult-to-model robot-ground interactions, and disturbances to the motion of the vehicle. Classical approaches to this problem rely on geometric analysis of the surrounding terrain, which can be prone to modeling errors and can be computationally expensive. Moreover, modeling the distribution of uncertain traversability costs is a difficult task, compounded by the various error sources mentioned above. In this work, we take a principled learning approach to this problem. We introduce a neural network architecture for robustly learning the distribution of traversability costs. Because we are motivated by preserving the life of the robot, we tackle this learning problem from the perspective of learning tail-risks, i.e. the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). We show that this approach reliably learns the expected tail risk given a desired probability risk threshold between 0 and 1, producing a traversability costmap which is more robust to outliers, more accurately captures tail risks, and is more computationally efficient, when compared against baselines. We validate our method on data collected by a legged robot navigating challenging, unstructured environments including an abandoned subway, limestone caves, and lava tube caves.",ar,2022-01-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,deep learning methods | field robots | motion and path planning | Planning under uncertainty | robotics in hazardous fields,2-s2.0-85118609367,,,Article,Fan D.D.,60019647;60009037,Georgia Institute of Technology;Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Atlanta;Pasadena,United States;United States,3,"Fan, David D.;Agha-Mohammadi, Ali Akbar;Theodorou, Evangelos A.",57193090982;54792649700;23398293600,60019647-60009037;60009037;60019647,1 January 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,1,,279-286,0,,undefined,,7,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2021.3125047
10.1109/LRA.2021.3116703,Learning Robot Exploration Strategy with 4D Point-Clouds-Like Information as Observations,"Being able to explore unknown environments is a requirement for fully autonomous robots. Many learning-based methods have been proposed to learn an exploration strategy. In the frontier-based exploration, learning algorithms tend to learn the optimal or near-optimal frontier to explore. Most of these methods represent the environments as fixed size images and take these as inputs to neural networks. However, the size of environments is usually unknown, which makes these methods fail to generalize to real world scenarios. To address this issue, we present a novel state representation method based on 4D point-clouds-like information, including the locations, frontier, and distance information. We also design a neural network that can process these 4D point-clouds-like information and generate the estimated value for each frontier. Then this neural network is trained using the typical reinforcement learning framework. We test the performance of our proposed method by comparing it with other five methods and test its scalability on maps that are much larger than maps in the training set. The experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method needs shorter average traveling distances to explore whole environments and can be adopted in maps with arbitrarily sizes.",ar,2022-01-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,autonomous agents | Learning from experience | motion and path planning,2-s2.0-85116939941,,,Article,Li Z.,60114181;60105683;60002798,Tencent;Southern University of Science and Technology;Chinese University of Hong Kong,Shenzhen;Shenzhen;Hong Kong,China;China;Hong Kong,4,"Li, Zhaoting;Li, Tingguang;Wang, Jiankun;Meng, Max Q.H.",57225184487;57202946136;57200020647;7102739136,60105683;60114181;60105683;60105683-60002798,1 January 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,1,,1-8,0,SUSTech,ZDSYS20200810171800001,Southern University of Science and Technology,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2021.3116703
10.1109/LRA.2021.3116700,Sim2real Learning of Obstacle Avoidance for Robotic Manipulators in Uncertain Environments,"Obstacle avoidance for robotic manipulators can be challenging when they operate in unstructured environments. This problem is probed with the sim-to-real (sim2real) deep reinforcement learning, such that a moving policy of the robotic arm is learnt in a simulator and then adapted to the real world. However, the problem of sim2real adaptation is notoriously difficult. To this end, this work proposes (1) a unified representation of obstacles and targets to capture the underlying dynamics of the environment while allowing generalization to unseen goals and (2) a flexible end-to-end model combining the unified representation with the deep reinforcement learning control module that can be trained by interacting with the environment. Such a representation is agnostic to the shape and appearance of the underlying objects, which simplifies and unifies the scene representation in both simulated and real worlds. We implement this idea with a vision-based actor-critic framework by devising a bounding box predictor module. The predictor estimates the 3D bounding boxes of obstacles and targets from the RGB-D input. The features extracted by the predictor are fed into the policy network, and all the modules are jointly trained. This makes the policy learn object-aware scene representation, which leads to a data-efficient learning of the obstacle avoidance policy. Our experiments in simulated environment and the real-world show that the end-to-end model of the unified representation achieves better sim2real adaption and scene generalization than state-of-the-art techniques.",ar,2022-01-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,"collision avoidance | Planning under uncertainty | reinforcement learning | robotic manipulator, unified representation",2-s2.0-85116877007,,,Article,Zhang T.,60122037;60011873;60000937,Shenzhen Technology University;Oakland University;Shenzhen University,Shenzhen;Rochester;Shenzhen,China;United States;China,5,"Zhang, Tan;Zhang, Kefang;Lin, Jiatao;Louie, Wing Yue Geoffrey;Huang, Hui",57307243100;57292090500;58392406900;55515613600;55504198700,60122037;60000937;60000937;60011873;60000937,1 January 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,1,,65-72,0,,undefined,,13,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2021.3116700

A learning optimization (LO) framework is established. Multiple criteria are defined to evaluate the performance quantitatively, and implementations with different sub-methods are discussed. In particular, a database generation method based on input space mapping is proposed for generating valid and representative samples. The methods presented are applied on a practical application—haptic interaction in virtual reality systems. The results show that the input space mapping method significantly elevates the efficiency and quality of database generation and consequently improves the performance of the LO. With the LO method, real-time trajectory generation with high dimensional inputs is achieved, which lays the foundation for robots with high dimensional DOFs to execute complex tasks in dynamic environments.",ar,2022-01-01,Engineering Optimization,global optimization | human–robot interaction | machine learning | Real-time trajectory planning | serial manipulators,2-s2.0-85113255459,,,Article,Zhang S.,60013789,Beihang University,Beijing,China,3,"Zhang, Shiyu;Dai, Shuling;Zhao, Yongjia",57200408462;7203008798;36095369500,60013789;60013789;60013789,2022,0305215X,29114,10290273,Journal,54,10,,1724-1742,0,,undefined,,1,2022,https://doi.org/10.1080/0305215X.2021.1958210

In this work, we present iRoPro, an interactive Robot Programming framework that allows end-users with little to no technical background to teach a robot new reusable actions. We combine Programming by Demonstration and Automated Planning techniques to allow the user to construct the robot’s knowledge base by teaching new actions by kinesthetic demonstration. The actions are generalised and reused with a task planner to solve previously unseen problems defined by the user. We implement iRoPro as an end-to-end system on a Baxter Research Robot to simultaneously teach low- and high-level actions by demonstration that the user can customise via a Graphical User Interface to adapt to their specific use case. To evaluate the feasibility of our approach, we first conducted pre-design experiments to better understand the user’s adoption of involved concepts and the proposed robot programming process.

10.1016/j.eswa.2023.121037,Knowledge-guided robot learning on compliance control for robotic assembly task with predictive model,"Nowadays industrial robots have become the key equipment in the context of smart manufacturing and the assembly process is seen as one of the dominant fields of robotic applications. However, robotic assembly still greatly relies on manual programming and performs in a highly controlled and structured environment in a repetitive manner with weak generalization. Recent successes in robot learning show that endowing robot intelligence to obtain skills autonomously is a promising approach. The existing robot learning methods are difficult to apply due to the requirement of sufficient trial-and-error exploration which is hardware-cost and time-consuming. When encountering an unfamiliar task, it is natural for human to use their prior knowledge as guidance to derive the explorative action and then leaning the related skills from the accumulated experience. Inspired by that, this paper proposes a knowledge-guided robot learning method with predictive model to improve the safety and efficiency of assembly skills acquisition. Concretely, based on Cartesian compliance control, a knowledge-guided exploration strategy (KGES) using the fuzzy logic about position/force feedback is built to provide direction and limit the range of exploration in the early learning stages. Upon KGES, a predictive model-based reinforcement learning method is proposed to optimize the local searching trajectory, where the training data, generated from the trained ensemble predictive models with a knowledge-guided branched progressive rollout method, is used for policy optimization. Finally, the proposed method is tested in two peg-in-hole assembly tasks in MuJoCo environment, and the results show that the robot can learn the assembly skill faster and perform better in success rate than model-free and knowledge-free settings while maintaining the contact force within a safe range.",ar,2023-12-30,Expert Systems with Applications,Compliance control | Knowledge-guided robot learning | Model-based reinforcement learning | Robotic assembly | Smart manufacturing,2-s2.0-85166654759,S0957417423015397,,Article,Liu Q.,60022414,Wuhan University of Technology,Wuhan,China,6,"Liu, Quan;Ji, Zhenrui;Xu, Wenjun;Liu, Zhihao;Yao, Bitao;Zhou, Zude",55577742400;57214917794;57221159460;57202399533;56405052900;58407029600,60022414;60022414;60022414;60022414;60022414;60022414,30 December 2023,09574174,24201,,Journal,234,,121037,,0,NSFC,JCKY2020206B015,National Natural Science Foundation of China,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.121037

10.1016/j.infsof.2023.107308,Auto-COP: Adaptation generation in Context-oriented Programming using Reinforcement Learning options,"Context: Self-adaptive software systems continuously adapt in response to internal and external changes in their execution environment, captured as contexts. The Context-oriented Programming (COP) paradigm posits a technique for the development of self-adaptive systems, capturing their main characteristics with specialized programming language constructs. In COP, adaptations are specified as independent modules that are composed in and out of the base system as contexts are activated and deactivated in response to sensed circumstances from the surrounding environment. However, the definition of adaptations, their contexts and associated specialized behavior, need to be specified at design time. In complex cyber–physical systems this is intractable, if not impossible, due to new unpredicted operating conditions arising. Objective: In this paper, we propose Auto-COP, a new technique to enable generation of adaptations at run time. Auto-COP uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) options to build action sequences, based on the previous instances of the system execution (for example, atomic system actions enacted by human operators). Options are further explored in interaction with the environment, and the most suitable options for each context are used to generate the adaptations, exploiting COP abstractions. Method: To validate Auto-COP, we present two case studies exhibiting different system characteristics and application domains: a driving assistant and a robot delivery system. We present examples of Auto-COP to illustrate the types of circumstances (contexts) requiring adaptation at run time, and the corresponding generated adaptations for each context. Results: We confirm that the generated adaptations exhibit correct system behavior measured by domain-specific performance metrics (e.g., conformance to specified speed limit), while reducing the number of required execution/actuation steps by a factor of two showing that the adaptations are regularly selected by the running system as adaptive behavior is more appropriate than the execution of atomic actions. Conclusion: Therefore, we demonstrate that Auto-COP is able to increase system adaptivity by enabling run-time generation of new adaptations for conditions detected at run time, while retaining the modularity offered by COP languages, and reducing the upfront specification required by system developers.",ar,2023-12-01,Information and Software Technology,Context-oriented programming | Macro actions | Option learning | Reinforcement learning | Self-adaptive systems,2-s2.0-85167819649,S0950584923001635,,Article,Cardozo N.,60052106;60011149,"Universidad de Los Andes, Colombia;Trinity College Dublin",Bogota;Dublin,Colombia;Ireland,2,"Cardozo, Nicolás;Dusparic, Ivana",37040461800;11641263400,60052106;60011149,December 2023,09505849,18732,,Journal,164,,107308,,1,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2023.107308

These facts have motivated the development of a new middleware to meet the requirements of usability by non-experts. The proposed middleware is based on Android and is intended to be placed over existing robot SDKs and middleware. It runs on the android tablet of the Cruzr robot. Various toolings have been developed, such as a web component to control the robot via a webinterface, which facilitates its use. Methods: The middleware was developed using Android Java and runs on the Cruzr tablet as an app. It features a WebSocket server that interfaces with the robot and allows control via Python or other WebSocket-compatible languages. The speech interface utilizes Google Cloud Voice text-to-speech and speech-to-text services. The interface was implemented in Python, allowing for easy integration with existing robotics development workflows, and a web interface was developed for direct control of the robot via the web. Results: The new robot middleware was created and deployed on a Cruzr robot, relying on the WebSocket API and featuring a Python implementation. It supports various robot functions, such as text-to-speech, speech-to-text, navigation, displaying content and scanning bar codes. The system’s architecture allows for porting the interface to other robots and platforms, showcasing its adaptability. It has been demonstrated that the middleware can be run on a Pepper robot, although not all functions have been implemented yet. The middleware was utilized to implement healthcare use cases and received good feedback. Conclusion: Cloud and local speech services were discussed in regard to the middleware’s needs, to run without having to change any code on other robots. An outlook on how the programming interface can further be simplified by using natural text to code generators has been/is given.

Existing methods like model predictive control often suffer from heavy online computational burdens. Reinforcement learning has shown promise in computer and board games but has yet to be widely adopted in industrial applications due to a lack of accessible, high-accuracy solvers. Current Reinforcement learning (RL) solvers are often developed for academic research and require a significant amount of theoretical knowledge and programming skills. Besides, many of them only support Python-based environments and limit to model-free algorithms. To address this gap, this paper develops General Optimal control Problems Solver (GOPS), an easy-to-use RL solver package that aims to build real-time and high-performance controllers in industrial fields. GOPS is built with a highly modular structure that retains a flexible framework for secondary development. Considering the diversity of industrial control tasks, GOPS also includes a conversion tool that allows for the use of Matlab/Simulink to support environment construction, controller design, and performance validation. To handle large-scale problems, GOPS can automatically create various serial and parallel trainers by flexibly combining embedded buffers and samplers.

With increasing awareness of sustainable practices in the manufacturing environment, this study addresses a sustainable SSALBP, where a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated for the first time for this type of assembly systems. The model consists of three objectives and each of the objectives represents the three pillars of sustainability. The problem becomes more realistic by considering uncertainty in processing time and the influence of human workers’ age and skill in processing time. The uncertainty is adopted in the MILP model by using a chance-constraint programing approach. Since the problem is complex, Q-learning and Monte-Carlo simulation-assisted based genetic algorithm (GA) based memetic algorithm (MA) are proposed to solve the problem. The performance of MA is evaluated against the well-known non-dominated sorting GA-III (NSGA-III) and state-of-the-art algorithms for solving the problem. The experimental results show that MA surpasses its contest significantly in finding better Pareto-fronts.",ar,2023-11-30,Expert Systems with Applications,Chance constraint programming | Cycle time | Energy | Ergonomic risks | Memetic algorithm | Semi-automated assembly line,2-s2.0-85162084798,S0957417423012393,,Article,Rahman H.F.,60160756;60033125;60010618,Cardiff School of Management;University of Leicester;Vellore Institute of Technology,Cardiff;Leicester;Vellore,United Kingdom;United Kingdom;India,3,"Rahman, Humyun Fuad;Janardhanan, Mukund Nilakantan;Ponnambalam, S.

10.1016/j.eswa.2023.120630,Hierarchical path planner for unknown space exploration using reinforcement learning-based intelligent frontier selection,"Path planning in unknown environments is extremely useful for some specific tasks, such as exploration of outer space planets, search and rescue in disaster areas, home sweeping services, etc. However, existing frontier-based path planners suffer from insufficient exploration, while reinforcement learning (RL)-based ones are confronted with problems in efficient training and effective searching. To overcome the above problems, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical path planner for unknown space exploration using RL-based intelligent frontier selection. Firstly, by decomposing the path planner into three-layered architecture (including the perception layer, planning layer, and control layer) and using edge detection to find potential frontiers to track, the path search space is shrunk from the whole map to a handful of points of interest, which significantly saves the computational resources in both training and execution processes. Secondly, one of the advanced RL algorithms, trust region policy optimization (TRPO), is used as a judge to select the best frontier for the robot to track, which ensures the optimality of the path planner with a shorter path length. The proposed method is validated through simulation and compared with both classic and state-of-the-art methods. Results show that the training process could be greatly accelerated compared with the traditional deep-Q network (DQN). Moreover, the proposed method has 4.2%–14.3% improvement in exploration region rate and achieves the highest exploration completeness.",ar,2023-11-15,Expert Systems with Applications,Edge detection | Path planning | Trust region policy optimization | Unknown space exploration,2-s2.0-85161641352,S0957417423011326,,Article,Fan J.,60016835,Beijing Institute of Technology,Beijing,China,3,"Fan, Jie;Zhang, Xudong;Zou, Yuan",57467526200;53867618800;57212182693,60016835;60016835;60016835,15 November 2023,09574174,24201,,Journal,230,,120630,,0,CAST,3212013,Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.120630
10.1016/j.comnet.2023.109982,Res-TranBiLSTM: An intelligent approach for intrusion detection in the Internet of Things,"The Internet of Things (IoT), as the information carrier of the Internet and telecommunications networks, is a new network technology comprising physical entities embedded with electronic components, software and sensors, and characterized by strong complexity and openness. With the massive amount of data, the occurrence of network intrusion is also increasingly frequent, involving industrial control systems, IoT devices, mobile security, cloud services, and telecommunications services. With the diversification and intelligence of cyberattack behaviors, traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) face problems—such as insufficient feature extraction and inaccurate model classification—when faced with high-dimensional features and nonlinear massive data. Due to their powerful data representation learning ability, deep learning methods save substantial time in processing high-dimensional and complex intrusion data. On this basis, we propose an intrusion detection model using ResNet, Transformer and BiLSTM (Res-TranBiLSTM) that takes into account both the spatial and temporal features of network traffic. We use the Synthetic Minor Overriding Technique (SMOTE) – Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN) method to alleviate the degree of data imbalance. In addition, we respectively establish a spatial feature extraction model based on ResNet and a temporal feature extraction model based on Transformer and BiLSTM to extract spatial features and temporal features parallelly. Finally, spatiotemporal features are included to achieve attack detection and classification. Further, simulation experiments are conducted using the public data sets NSL-KDD and CIC-IDS2017. The experiments are implemented using Python programming language and Pytorch framework. The results reveal that the performance of our proposed model is better than that of other models, with accuracy reaching 90.99%, 99.15% and 99.56%, on NSL-KDD dataset, CIC-IDS2017 dataset and MQTTset dataset, respectively. It increased the detection accuracy by about 1%-10% on NSL-KDD dataset and about 0.2%-10% on CIC-IDS2017 dataset, and about 1%-10% on MQTTset dataset. These results demonstrate that this method is effective in constructing and optimizing large-scale IDS in the IoT environment.",ar,2023-11-01,Computer Networks,BiLSTM | Cyberattacks | Cybersecurity | Feature fusion | Intrusion detection systems | IoT networks | Transformer,2-s2.0-85170286625,S1389128623004279,,Article,Wang S.,60010953;60001081,Donghua University;China Telecommunications,Shanghai;Beijing,China;China,3,"Wang, Shiyu;Xu, Wenxiang;Liu, Yiwen",58336407700;58115011500;57886380000,60001081;60001081;60010953,November 2023,13891286,26811,,Journal,235,,109982,,1,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2023.109982
10.1016/j.compag.2023.108183,A heuristic tomato-bunch harvest manipulator path planning method based on a 3D-CNN-based position posture map and rapidly-exploring random tree,"The environment of tomato bunches is complex, and the fruit volume is relatively large, so manipulator picking-harvest motion planning should consider not only how to pick, but also how to avoid obstacles after picking tomato bunches and harvesting them from the complex environment, which puts forward strict requirements for picking-harvest motion performance. However, existing sampling-based algorithms still have problems of blind expansion and low efficiency. To solve these problems, a heuristic tomato-bunch harvest manipulator path planning method based on a 3D-CNN (convolution neural network)-based position posture map (PPM) and rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) is proposed in this paper. This method comprehensively considers the sampling effectiveness of the whole process of picking and harvesting, search speed, path cost and manipulability of the manipulator, combining a sampling-based path planning algorithm and deep learning framework. The method utilizes CNN and FCN (Fully Connected Neural Networks) for generating a heuristic cost map where each voxel has a cost-to-go value toward the target and an optimal target posture value to guide the expansion tree. In addition, the sampling space of obstacle avoidance planning is reduced by a spatial partition method, and the difficulty caused by the increase in the volume of the end-effector clamping fruit is solved by prioritizing the planning of the fruit harvest path and then planning the picking path. On the basis of the above research, a large number of harvest experiments have verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Research and experimental results show that, based on the PPM-RRT algorithm, the picking-harvest time of a single tomato bunch is 13 s, and the success rate is close to 100%. Compared with state-of-the-art sampling algorithms, the planning time is reduced by more than 70%, the path length is reduced by more than 24%, and the manipulability of the manipulator is increased by 38.9%.

10.1109/LRA.2023.3308061,LEAGUE: Guided Skill Learning and Abstraction for Long-Horizon Manipulation,"To assist with everyday human activities, robots must solve complex long-horizon tasks and generalize to new settings. Recent deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods show promise in fully autonomous learning, but they struggle to reach long-term goals in large environments. On the other hand, Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approaches excel at solving and generalizing across long-horizon tasks, thanks to their powerful state and action abstractions. But they assume predefined skill sets, which limits their real-world applications. In this work, we combine the benefits of these two paradigms and propose an integrated task planning and skill learning framework named LEAGUE (Learning and Abstraction with Guidance). LEAGUE leverages the symbolic interface of a task planner to guide RL-based skill learning and creates abstract state space to enable skill reuse. More importantly, LEAGUE learns manipulation skills in-situ of the task planning system, continuously growing its capability and the set of tasks that it can solve. We evaluate LEAGUE on four challenging simulated task domains and show that LEAGUE outperforms baselines by large margins. We also show that the learned skills can be reused to accelerate learning in new tasks domains and transfer to a physical robot platform.",ar,2023-10-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,continual learning | Reinforcement learning | task and motion planning,2-s2.0-85168730251,,,Article,Cheng S.,60019647,Georgia Institute of Technology,Atlanta,United States,2,"Cheng, Shuo;Xu, Danfei",57951725100;57191429236,60019647;60019647,1 October 2023,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,8,10,,6451-6458,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2023.3308061
10.1109/LRA.2023.3303721,Learning to Shape by Grinding: Cutting-Surface-Aware Model-Based Reinforcement Learning,"Object shaping by grinding is a crucial industrial process in which a rotating grinding belt removes material. Object-shape transition models are essential to achieving automation by robots; however, learning such a complex model that depends on process conditions is challenging because it requires a significant amount of data, and the irreversible nature of the removal process makes data collection expensive. This letter proposes a cutting-surface-aware Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) method for robotic grinding. Our method employs a cutting-surface-aware model as the object's shape transition model, which in turn is composed of a geometric cutting model and a cutting-surface-deviation model, based on the assumption that the robot action can specify the cutting surface made by the tool. Furthermore, according to the grinding resistance theory, the cutting-surface-deviation model does not require raw shape information, making the model's dimensions smaller and easier to learn than a naive shape transition model directly mapping the shapes. Through evaluation and comparison by simulation and real robot experiments, we confirm that our MBRL method can achieve high data efficiency for learning object shaping by grinding and also provide generalization capability for initial and target shapes that differ from the training data.",ar,2023-10-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Manipulation planning | model learning for control | reinforcement learning,2-s2.0-85167816569,,,Article,Hachimine T.,60119325;60025017;60001271,Graduate School of Informatics;Nara Institute of Science and Technology;Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International (ATR),Kyoto;Ikoma;Kyoto,Japan;Japan;Japan,3,"Hachimine, Takumi;Morimoto, Jun;Matsubara, Takamitsu",58534661700;36464057500;10242801500,60025017;60119325-60001271;60025017,1 October 2023,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,8,10,,6235-6242,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2023.3303721

However, SME productions are usually in semi-structured or cluttered environments, which raises major challenges in implementing cobot systems in SME production, for instance, increasing the visual perception of cobots, handling diverse tasks, and fast deploying cobot systems, etc. Therefore, we propose an automation framework for SME production by addressing these challenges with cobots to facilitate their production.

Then, the multi-functional gripper system is designed and fabricated to be capable of performing multiple operations and tasks without tool changing, and be able to tolerate a certain level of changes in the environment. After that, a digital twin of the robotic system is developed, which enables the system developer to save time in troubleshooting and debugging, and the customers to have a customized model with all the elements and functions required before system deployment. Finally, the onsite testing of the integrated system is conducted in collaboration with our SME industrial partner, and the test results show that the cobot system can perform the automated production process well and accurately.

We introduce the transformer structure into policy neural networks for the first time, dramatically enhancing the ability of policy neural networks to extract features that facilitate collaboration between robots. It mainly focuses on improving the performance of policies in relatively dense multirobot environments under conditions where robots do not communicate with each other. Furthermore, a novel imitation reinforcement learning framework is proposed by combining contrastive learning and double deep Q-network to solve the problem of difficulty training policy neural networks after introducing the transformer structure. We present results in the simulation environment and compare the resulting policy against advanced multirobot path-planning methods in terms of success rate.

We consider several problems arising in the design process, including training a system to be robust to rare events, testing its performance under different conditions, and debugging failures. We show how a probabilistic programming language can help address these problems by specifying distributions encoding interesting types of inputs, then sampling these to generate specialized training and test data. More generally, such languages can be used to write environment models, an essential prerequisite to any formal analysis. In this paper, we focus on systems such as autonomous cars and robots, whose environment at any point in time is a scene, a configuration of physical objects and agents. We design a domain-specific language, Scenic, for describing scenarios that are distributions over scenes and the behaviors of their agents over time. Scenic combines concise, readable syntax for spatiotemporal relationships with the ability to declaratively impose hard and soft constraints over the scenario. We develop specialized techniques for sampling from the resulting distribution, taking advantage of the structure provided by Scenic’s domain-specific syntax.

10.1016/j.rineng.2023.101356,The future of the technology-based manufacturing in the European Union,"The manufacturing industry tries to innovate always to cater to customer-oriented products. The digitization of manufacturing is revolutionizing the future of this industry. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is bringing down the labor cost, reducing the machine downtime, and overall increasing the production speed. A new technological trend like Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses computer algorithms based on available data and can improve or decide further, automatically, based on experience, without the need for prior programming commands. ML can improve daily processes for identifying bottlenecks, developing products, controlling quality, providing security to the industry, and using AI robotics in place of humans. On one hand, technologies like ML, AI, IIoT, new materials, photonics, and rapid prototyping are driving the manufacturing sector in adopting a future version of Industry 4.0, and on the other hand, the European Commission (EC) has defined a roadmap until 2050 or more, in achieving the sustainable goal of carbon-neutrality and complete digitalization with resilience across the European continent. However, it is challenging to match the planned and actual roadmaps to the future of the technology-based manufacturing industry. There are uncertainties about how the future will be shaped by technologies in the EU manufacturing industry, in the changing political, environmental and social world environment. Recognizing these difficulties, the current article consults the available literature on this topic to determine the factors that will characterize the future of the manufacturing industry across EU countries. The relevant information about the EU manufacturing sectors has first been collected from various sources like Eurostat data, the EC policy documents, manufacturing company's annual reports, research reviews, journal articles, EU Industry Days annual event, etc. Then the collected data were analyzed to gain insight into the future of the technology-based EU manufacturing industry in the context of the European Commission's outlined policies. Variable factors from different manufacturing sectors are presented from different EU member states and scenario analysis was used for understanding the possible future. It is concluded that the future does not lie in adapting to the changing environment but in creating the future by EU companies themselves - revolution must be met by revolution. Their early experiences and path dependency can be seen as stubbornness, which may act as formidable barriers to building new capabilities.

10.1109/LRA.2023.3300576,FNPG-NH: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Flexible Needle Path Generation With Nonholonomic Constraints,"Path planning algorithms for minimally invasive neurosurgery involve avoiding critical structures such as blood vessels and ventricles while following needle kinematics. The majority of planning solutions proposed in the literature use sampling-based algorithms. This letter introduces a Flexible Needle Path Generation framework with Non-Holonomic constraints (FNPG-NH), an extension of our FNPG framework. FNPG-NH uses deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) based methods such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) to obtain a kinematically feasible path for a bevel-tipped flexible needle using a nonholonomic model. RL algorithms presented in this work generate the control input for needle rotation based on the rewards generated by the environment. The deep RL algorithms are trained on an environment that consists of 1) ventricles segmented from T1 images of the healthy volunteers using atlas-based segmentation, 2) blood vessels segmented from MRA volumes of the same volunteer using thresholding, and 3) tumor volume from labeled BraTS 2020 dataset and placed at an anatomically relevant location. The paths generated by the reinforcement learning algorithm and the traditional sampling-based algorithm RRT are compared for various performance metrics. The reinforcement learning model was trained on 20 volumes and validated on 68 volumes, and RRT was evaluated on the same 68 validation volumes. The results show that the trajectories generated by the FNPG-NH framework are safer, shorter, and take less time than RRT while avoiding critical structures such as ventricles and blood vessels.",ar,2023-09-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,reinforcement learning | steerable catheters/needles | Surgical robotics: planning,2-s2.0-85166761038,,,Article,Shah M.,60025757,Indian Institute of Technology Madras,Chennai,India,2,"Shah, Mukund;Patel, Niravkumar",57194067605;58188334200,60025757;60025757,1 September 2023,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,8,9,,5854-5861,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2023.3300576

Collaborative robots are representative agents for various collaborative industrial tasks. This study focuses on contactless delivery by considering multiple agents. A contactless delivery operation must be performed with well-synchronized cooperation among the sender, a receiver, and flying dynamics of the deliverable. The most challenging task is to predict the catching point of a thrown package by considering both collaborative robots. Accurate catching-point prediction and relevant operations were achieved using the proposed physics-informed neural network-based hybrid multi-stream deep learning framework. Various cooperative environments were considered using multi-modal input data and manufacturing conditions. The proposed framework incorporates these constraints, and the prediction is guided by flying dynamics and trajectory data. The effectiveness of the proposed framework was demonstrated by implementing multi-agent and related manufacturing environments in a digital twin system. The effectiveness of the proposed framework was proven experimentally using analyses and comparisons with existing machine learning methods.",ar,2023-09-01,International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,Collaborative robot | Contactless delivery | Deep learning | Digital twin | Physics-informed neural network (PINN),2-s2.0-85165627833,,,Article,Lee H.,60019209,Kumoh National Institute of Technology,Gumi,South Korea,1,"Lee, Hyunsoo",57188685708,60019209,September 2023,02683768,20428,14333015,Journal,128,3-4,,1255-1270,0,MOE,NRF-2021R1A2C1008647,Ministry of Education,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00170-023-11956-3

An orientation angle reward component, linear velocity reward factor, and safety performance reward factor are added to the DDPG reward function based on kinematic modeling and analysis of mobile robots. A multi-objective performance index turns the path planning problem into one of multi-objective optimization. We propose KA-DDPG, which uses the orientation angle, linear speed, and safety degree as evaluation indices, and information entropy to alter the influence coefficient of the multi-objective function in the reward function. KAI-DDPG is proposed to address the low learning and training efficiency of KA-DDPG, using immune optimization to optimize the experience samples in the experience buffer pool. Performance indices of traditional path planning and the proposed techniques are compared on a gazebo simulation platform, and the results suggest that KAI-DDPG can mitigate the drawbacks of DDPG, such as a protracted training cycle and poor path planning technique, and can broaden the range of application.",ar,2023-09-01,Applied Soft Computing,DDPG | Immune algorithm | Mobile robot | Path planning | Reward function,2-s2.0-85165368971,S1568494623006191,,Article,Yan C.,60026846;101730741,Chengdu University of Technology;Cheng Du University,Chengdu;Chengdu,China;China,5,"Yan, Chengliang;Chen, Guangzhu;Li, Yang;Sun, Fuchun;Wu, Yuanyuan",57222491710;55912693100;58138118100;58498227800;55648673900,60026846;60026846;60026846;101730741;60026846,September 2023,15684946,18136,,Journal,145,,110601,,0,,2022JDGD0013,Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2023.110601

Previous learning-based methods relied on accurate knowledge of the environment, including the gap's pose and size. In contrast, we integrate onboard sensing and detect the gap from a single onboard camera. The training problem is challenging for two reasons: a precise and robust whole-body planning and control policy is required for variable-tilted and narrow gaps, and an effective Sim2Real method is needed to successfully conduct real-world experiments. To this end, we propose a learning framework for agile gap traversal flight, which successfully trains the vehicle to traverse through the center of the gap at an approximate attitude to the gap with aggressive tilted angles. The policy trained only in a simulation environment can be transferred into different domains with fine-tuning while maintaining the success rate. Our proposed framework, which integrates onboard sensing and a neural network controller, achieves a success rate of 87.36% in real-world experiments, with gap orientations up to 60°.

However, new detectors are not very accurate in some cases. To improve the accuracy, a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy is required. We propose a novel compound collision detector (CCD) for collision queries that modifies the planners of rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) to improve the classical probabilistic collision detector (PCD). It is composed of an exact collision detector (ECD), an inference collision detector (ICD) and a strategy to determine ECD or ICD based on some conditions. In our CCD, we use a sphere-ellipsoidal pseudo distance (SEPD) in the determination strategy to alleviate the problem of highly-frequent outputs of false-positive in narrow passages of PCD, and a node based bounding method (NBB) to increase the speed of data storage and loading for the sub-algorithm ICD. Experiments on a Kinova Jaco assistive robotic arm are taken to evaluate the performance of our CCD, which show an improved accuracy with a small reduction of speed in comparison with PCD.

Various programming education tools and methods have been developed to solve these problems in introductory programming education. For this reason, block-based and robot programming tools are widely used at various education levels, especially at the novice level. Although the advantages of using block-based and robot programming over classical or text-based programming methods in introductory programming education have been demonstrated in various studies, the two methods have not been compared in experimental studies. The main purpose of this study was to compare the effects of using block-based programming and robot programming methods in introductory programming education on students' perceptions of programming self-efficacy. The results of the study indicated that the perceptions of programming self-efficacy of the students who used the robot programming method in programming education were significantly more positive than those of the students who used the block-based programming method. Moreover, the programming self-efficacy perceptions of the male students who used robot programming in introductory programming education were significantly more positive than those of the female students.

10.1002/cae.22627,FEM education in undergraduate studies: Industry-informed research,"Recent mechanical engineering graduates are expected to utilize Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in structural and machine design activities. However, after decades of implementation in engineering schools, the Finite Element Method (FEM) still challenges instructors and course designers. To align learning outcomes with industrial requirements, this article analyzes the opinions of Mexican industrial and academic experts about four important aspects of FEM education. The results suggest that specialists agree on the importance of including a mixture of theoretical and applied topics in the syllabus but prefer practical skills over fundamental concepts. Besides learning from defeaturing to postprocessing a model, engineering students must know how to plan, verify, and validate their finite element studies. Experts expect early design engineers to be proficient with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and have relevant mathematical and programming skills. Instead of using specialized software, students' first exposure to FEM may be based on FEA tools embedded in CAD systems. Also, academic and industrial respondents request the incorporation of modal, thermal and nonlinear analysis procedures in the course timetable. Finally, the statistical analysis shows that the two types of respondents share one common vision about the importance of the aspects under study.

10.33263/BRIAC134.398,Using Bio-Realistic Gaussian-Shaped Population and Dopamine-Modulated STDP for Training a Self-Balancing System,"Human body balance is a gradual formation through repetition of actions, trial and error, and improving the mechanism of muscular-skeletal architecture for adapting to the demands of the environment. In the learning process, sensory receptors continuously send signals to the brain, then the brain to muscles and make a new signals pathway. Each time the body performs an action, millions of new synaptic connections are formed, and repetitive actions strengthen connections. So, a balanced body reuses the learned mechanism without performing any complex calculations. In contrast, the balance problem of a self-balancing robot has been solved by many different control algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel way to balance a two-wheeled self-balancing robot using bio-realistic Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to learn self-balancing, which is closely related to the way babies learn. To accomplish this, the gaussian shaped sensory neuronal population is connected with motor neurons through Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) based synapses, further controlled with dopamine neurons. The key aspects of this approach are its bio-realistic nature and zero dependencies on data for adopting a new behavior compared to Deep Reinforcement Learning.

10.1108/IR-11-2022-0289,Augmented reality-assisted gesture-based teleoperated system for robot motion planning,"Purpose: The study proposed a human–robot interaction (HRI) framework to enable operators to communicate remotely with robots in a simple and intuitive way. The study focused on the situation when operators with no programming skills have to accomplish teleoperated tasks dealing with randomly localized different-sized objects in an unstructured environment. The purpose of this study is to reduce stress on operators, increase accuracy and reduce the time of task accomplishment. The special application of the proposed system is in the radioactive isotope production factories. The following approach combined the reactivity of the operator’s direct control with the powerful tools of vision-based object classification and localization. Design/methodology/approach: Perceptive real-time gesture control predicated on a Kinect sensor is formulated by information fusion between human intuitiveness and an augmented reality-based vision algorithm. Objects are localized using a developed feature-based vision algorithm, where the homography is estimated and Perspective-n-Point problem is solved. The 3D object position and orientation are stored in the robot end-effector memory for the last mission adjusting and waiting for a gesture control signal to autonomously pick/place an object. Object classification process is done using a one-shot Siamese neural network (NN) to train a proposed deep NN; other well-known models are also used in a comparison. The system was contextualized in one of the nuclear industry applications: radioactive isotope production and its validation were performed through a user study where 10 participants of different backgrounds are involved. Findings: The system was contextualized in one of the nuclear industry applications: radioactive isotope production and its validation were performed through a user study where 10 participants of different backgrounds are involved. The results revealed the effectiveness of the proposed teleoperation system and demonstrate its potential for use by robotics non-experienced users to effectively accomplish remote robot tasks. Social implications: The proposed system reduces risk and increases level of safety when applied in hazardous environment such as the nuclear one. Originality/value: The contribution and uniqueness of the presented study are represented in the development of a well-integrated HRI system that can tackle the four aforementioned circumstances in an effective and user-friendly way. High operator–robot reactivity is kept by using the direct control method, while a lot of cognitive stress is removed using elective/flapped autonomous mode to manipulate randomly localized different configuration objects.

Learners are encouraged to take charge of their learning and, often the opportunity to independently design their learning experience. This research illustrates the use of technology in teaching and learning technology with a central theme of promoting self-directed learning with engaging self-design for both educators and learners. The technology used includes existing tools such as web page design, Learning Management Systems (LMS), project management tools, and basic programming foundations and concepts of big data and databases. In addition, end-users and developers can create their own tools with simple coding. Planning techniques, such as Visual Plan Construct Language with its embedded AI, are used to integrate course material and rubrics with time management. Educators may use project management tools instead. The research proposes a self-directed paradigm with self-designed resources using the existing technology with LMS modules, discussions, and self-tests. The research establishes its criteria for ensuring the quality of content and design, known as 7x2C. Additionally, other criteria for analysis, such as Design Thinking, are included. The approach is examined for a technology-based business course in creating an experiential learning system for COVID-19 awareness.

10.1109/LRA.2023.3292004,SACHA: Soft Actor-Critic With Heuristic-Based Attention for Partially Observable Multi-Agent Path Finding,"Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a crucial component for many large-scale robotic systems, where agents must plan their collision-free paths to their given goal positions. Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning has been introduced to solve the partially observable variant of MAPF by learning a decentralized single-agent policy in a centralized fashion based on each agent's partial observation. However, existing learning-based methods are ineffective in achieving complex multi-agent cooperation, especially in congested environments, due to the non-stationarity of this setting. To tackle this challenge, we propose a multi-agent actor-critic method called Soft Actor-Critic with Heuristic-Based Attention (SACHA), which employs novel heuristic-based attention mechanisms for both the actors and critics to encourage cooperation among agents. SACHA learns a neural network for each agent to selectively pay attention to the shortest path heuristic guidance from multiple agents within its field of view, thereby allowing for more scalable learning of cooperation. SACHA also extends the existing multi-agent actor-critic framework by introducing a novel critic centered on each agent to approximate Q-values. Compared to existing methods that use a fully observable critic, our agent-centered multi-agent actor-critic method results in more impartial credit assignment and better generalizability of the learned policy to MAPF instances with varying numbers of agents and types of environments. We also implement SACHA(C), which embeds a communication module in the agent's policy network to enable information exchange among agents. We evaluate both SACHA and SACHA(C) on a variety of MAPF instances and demonstrate decent improvements over several state-of-the-art learning-based MAPF methods with respect to success rate and solution quality.",ar,2023-08-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,deep learning methods | Path planning for multiple mobile robots or agents | reinforcement learning,2-s2.0-85164413265,,,Article,Lin Q.,60018491,Simon Fraser University,Burnaby,Canada,2,"Lin, Qiushi;Ma, Hang",58481182500;58482176700,60018491;60018491,1 August 2023,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,8,8,,5100-5107,0,NSERC,RGPIN2020-06540,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2023.3292004

However, most existing automaton based algorithms highly rely on the manually customized representation of states for the considered task, limiting its applicability in deep reinforcement learning algorithms. To address this issue, by incorporating Transformer into reinforcement learning, we develop a Double-Transformer-guided Temporal Logic framework (T2TL) that exploits the structural feature of Transformer twice, i.e., first encoding the LTL instruction via the Transformer module for efficient understanding of task instructions during the training and then encoding the context variable via the Transformer again for improved task performance. Particularly, the LTL instruction is specified by co-safe LTL. As a semantics-preserving rewriting operation, LTL progression is exploited to decompose the complex task into learnable sub-goals, which not only converts non-Markovian reward decision processes to Markovian ones, but also improves the sampling efficiency by simultaneous learning of multiple sub-tasks. An environment-agnostic LTL pre-training scheme is further incorporated to facilitate the learning of the Transformer module resulting in an improved representation of LTL. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the T2TL framework.",ar,2023-08-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Linear temporal logic | motion planning | reinforcement learning,2-s2.0-85163542111,,,Article,Zhang H.,60019118,University of Science and Technology of China,Hefei,China,3,"Zhang, Hao;Wang, Hao;Kan, Zhen",57864184200;56018353200;36548225700,60019118;60019118;60019118,1 August 2023,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,8,8,,4831-4838,0,NSFC,62173314,National Natural Science Foundation of China,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2023.3290511
10.1109/TRO.2023.3269384,Autonomous Navigation for Robot-Assisted Intraluminal and Endovascular Procedures: A Systematic Review,"Increased demand for less invasive procedures has accelerated the adoption of Intraluminal Procedures (IP) and Endovascular Interventions (EI) performed through body lumens and vessels. As navigation through lumens and vessels is quite complex, interest grows to establish autonomous navigation techniques for IP and EI for reaching the target area. Current research efforts are directed toward increasing the Level of Autonomy (LoA) during the navigation phase. One key ingredient for autonomous navigation is Motion Planning (MP) techniques. This paper provides an overview of MP techniques categorizing them based on LoA. Our analysis investigates advances for the different clinical scenarios. Through a systematic literature analysis using the PRISMA method, the study summarizes relevant works and investigates the clinical aim, LoA, adopted MP techniques, and validation types. We identify the limitations of the corresponding MP methods and provide directions to improve the robustness of the algorithms in dynamic intraluminal environments.

A FOON contains symbolic concepts useful to a robot's understanding of tasks and its environment for object-level planning. Prior to this work, little has been done to show how plans acquired from FOON can be executed by a robot, as the concepts in a FOON are too abstract for execution. We thereby introduce the idea of exploiting object-level knowledge as a FOON for task planning and execution. Our approach automatically transforms FOON into PDDL and leverages off-the-shelf planners, action contexts, and robot skills in a hierarchical planning pipeline to generate executable task plans. We demonstrate our entire approach on long-horizon tasks in CoppeliaSim and show how learned action contexts can be extended to never-before-seen scenarios.",ar,2023-08-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,learning from demonstration | manipulation planning | service robotics | Task and motion planning,2-s2.0-85162731627,,,Article,Paulius D.,60018163;60011460;60009999;60007798,Technische Universität Wien;Brown University;Universität Innsbruck;Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR),Vienna;Providence;Innsbruck;Koln,Austria;United States;Austria;Germany,3,"Paulius, David;Agostini, Alejandro;Lee, Dongheui",57192437676;24528329400;55661385300,60011460;60009999;60018163-60007798,1 August 2023,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,8,8,,4513-4520,0,ONR,N00014-21-1-2584,Office of Naval Research,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2023.3285510

Multiple predictive path points are dynamically generated by a deep Markov model optimized using an RL approach for the robot to track. To ensure safety when tracking the predictive points, the robot's motion is fine-tuned by a motion fine-tuning module. Such an approach, using a deep Markov model with RL algorithm for planning, focuses on the relationship between adjacent path points. We analyze the benefits of our proposed approach and show it is more effective and has higher success rates than the RL-based approach DWA-RL (Patel et al. 2021) and a traditional navigation approach APF (Chen et al. 2021).

Informative Path Planning methodologies have been successfully applied making robots able to autonomously acquire information and explore unknown surroundings. Rapidly-exploring Information Gathering approaches have been validated in real-world applications, proving they are the way to go when aiming for Information Gathering tasks. In fact, RIG can plan paths for robots with several degrees of freedom and rapidly explore complex workspaces by using the state-of-the-art Voronoi-biased expansion. Nevertheless, it is an efficient solution when most of the area is unknown but its effectiveness decreases as the exploration/gathering evolves. This paper introduces an innovative informed expansion for IG tasks that combines the Kernel Density Estimation technique and a rejection sampling algorithm. By learning online the distribution of the acquired information (i.e., the discovered map), the proposed methodology generates samples in the unexplored regions of the workspace, and thus steers the tree toward the most promising areas. Realistic simulations and an experimental campaign, conducted in the underwater robotics domain, provide a proof-of-concept validation for the developed informed expansion methodology and demonstrate that it enhances the performance of the RIG algorithm.",ar,2023-08-01,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,Autonomous Underwater Vehicles | Informative Path Planning | Informed expansion | Mobile robots,2-s2.0-85162218803,S092188902300088X,,Article,Zacchini L.,60021859;112602054,Università degli Studi di Firenze;Interuniversity Research Center on Integrated Systems for the Marine Environment,Florence;Genoa,Italy;Italy,3,"Zacchini, Leonardo;Ridolfi, Alessandro;Allotta, Benedetto",57209645356;55179249500;7004405173,60021859-112602054;60021859-112602054;60021859-112602054,August 2023,09218890,18079,,Journal,166,,104449,,1,GSA,101004234,Gerontological Society of America,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2023.104449

These scenarios often require robots to satisfy multiple conflicting objectives with different relative preferences, such as work efficiency, safety, and smoothness, which inherently cause robots’ poor exploration in seeking policies optimizing several performance criteria. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective deep reinforcement learning framework for crowd-aware robot navigation problems to learn policies over multiple competing objectives whose relative importance preference is dynamic to the robot. First, a two-stream structure is introduced to separately extract the spatial and temporal features of pedestrian motion characteristics. Second, to learn navigation policies for each possible preference, a multi-objective deep reinforcement learning method is proposed to maximize a weighted-sum scalarization of different objective functions. We consider path planning and path tracking tasks, which focus on conflicting objectives of collision avoidance, target reaching, and path following.

This research aims to improve SSC prediction accuracy by constructing a comprehensive and integrated deep learning model Wavelet-MGGP-CNN-LSTM (ICNN-LSTM), combining wavelet transformation (WT), multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) simultaneously. In ICNN-LSTM, the WT decomposes the signal and extracts time and frequency domain information, while the MGGP filters out redundant information. Then, the CNN and LSTM are integrated in a parallel and loosely coupled manner to form an initial combined model CNN-LSTM (CNN combined with LSTM) to process filtered information by WT and MGGP. Furthermore, this study compares the performance of ICNN-LSTM with CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, ICNN (CNN embedded with WT and MGGP), ILSTM (LSTM embedded with WT and MGGP), artificial neural network (ANN), and the traditional sediment rating curve (SRC). The evaluation of prediction accuracy for all models was conducted using root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSC), coefficient of determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE) as performance indicators. The daily discharge and suspended sediment concentration series data from Tangnaihai Hydrological Station in the upper reaches of the Yellow River spanning from 1977 to 1987 were selected to train and test the models. Results show that, first, deep learning networks such as CNN and LSTM outperform the shallow neural network ANN, with LSTM providing higher accuracy than CNN. Second, the CNN-LSTM hybrid outperforms both CNN and LSTM models, exhibiting a nearly 89% improvement in NSC value compared to SRC in the test phase. Third, deep learning models such as ICNN, ILSTM, and ICNN-LSTM show significantly higher NSC values than CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM models in the test phase, with improvements of 13.8%, 5.7%, and 12.1%, respectively. Moreover, compared to SRC, the proposed ICNN-LSTM model improves NSC value by nearly 140% in the test phase.

Knowing the user's intention, represented as desired goal conditions, allows the robot to generalize across variations of the learned task seen at execution time. However, it has proven challenging to learn goal conditions due to the large, noisy, and complex space of goal conditions expressed by human users. This paper introduces Semantic Robot Programming with Multiple Demonstrations (SRP-MD) to learn a generative model of latent end-user task goal conditions from multiple end-user demonstrations in a shared workspace. By learning a generative model of the goal conditions, SRP-MD generalizes to task instances even when the quantity of objects to be arranged is not in the training set or novel object instances are included. At test time, a new goal is pulled from the learned generative model given the objects present in the initial scene. The efficacy of SRP-MD as a step toward taskable robots is shown on a Fetch robot learning and executing bin packing tasks in a simulated environment with grocery items.",ar,2023-08-01,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,Goal inference | Learning from demonstration | Programming by demonstration | Task learning | Taskable robots,2-s2.0-85160622348,S0921889023000362,,Article,French K.D.,60025778,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",Ann Arbor,United States,6,"French, Kevin David;Kim, Ji Hwang;Du, Yidong;Goeddel, Elizabeth Mamantov;Zeng, Zhen;Jenkins, Odest Chadwicke",57210799494;58295514500;57310954600;58295843300;57200625070;35589011000,60025778;60025778;60025778;60025778;60025778;60025778,August 2023,09218890,18079,,Journal,166,,104397,,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2023.104397

Path planning divides the global path into segments by setting up segmented sites by using the beetle genetic operator. Local path planning between sites is classified according to the characteristics of obstacles, and the artificial potential field method is used to guide the search. The nature of water flow method is used to plan the obstacle avoidance route, optimize the obstacle avoidance process, and effectively avoid falling into local trap obstacles. Finally, the site coordinates are optimized by the beetle antennae search algorithm to improve the path quality and prevent the path from falling into local optimum.

10.1109/TSMC.2023.3262954,Self-Correcting Quadratic Programming-Based Robot Control,"Quadratic programming (QP)-based controllers allow many robotic systems, such as humanoids, to successfully undertake complex motions and interactions. However, these approaches rely heavily on adequately capturing the underlying model of the environment and the robot's dynamics. This assumption, nevertheless, is rarely satisfied, and we usually turn to well-tuned end-effector PD controllers to compensate for model mismatches. In this article, we propose to augment traditional QP-based controllers with a learned residual inverse dynamics (IDs) model and an adaptive control law that adjusts the QP online to account for model uncertainties and unforeseen disturbances. In particular, we propose: 1) learning a residual IDs model using the Gaussian Process and linearizing it so that it can be incorporated inside the QP-control optimization procedure and 2) a novel combination of adaptive control and QP-based methods to avoid the manual tuning of end-effector PID controllers and faster convergence in learning the residual dynamics model. In simulation, we extensively evaluate our method in several robotic scenarios ranging from a 7-degrees of freedom (DoFs) manipulator tracking a trajectory to a humanoid robot performing a waving motion for which the model used by the controller and the one used in the simulated world do not match (unmodeled dynamics).

In this article, we present the active neural sensing approach that generates the kinematically feasible viewpoint sequences for the robot manipulator with an in-hand camera to gather the minimum number of observations needed to reconstruct the underlying environment. Our framework actively collects the visual RGBD observations, aggregates them into scene representation, and performs object shape inference to avoid unnecessary robot interactions with the environment. We train our approach on synthetic data with domain randomization and demonstrate its successful execution via sim-to-real transfer in reconstructing narrow, covered, real-world cabinet environments cluttered with unknown objects.

10.1109/TRO.2023.3257549,DRL-VO: Learning to Navigate Through Crowded Dynamic Scenes Using Velocity Obstacles,"This article proposes a novel learning-based control policy with strong generalizability to new environments that enables a mobile robot to navigate autonomously through spaces filled with both static obstacles and dense crowds of pedestrians. The policy uses a unique combination of input data to generate the desired steering angle and forward velocity: a short history of lidar data, kinematic data about nearby pedestrians, and a subgoal point. The policy is trained in a reinforcement learning setting using a reward function that contains a novel term based on velocity obstacles to guide the robot to actively avoid pedestrians and move toward the goal. Through a series of 3-D simulated experiments with up to 55 pedestrians, this control policy is able to achieve a better balance between collision avoidance and speed (i.e., higher success rate and faster average speed) than state-of-the-art model-based and learning-based policies, and it also generalizes better to different crowd sizes and unseen environments. An extensive series of hardware experiments demonstrate the ability of this policy to directly work in different real-world environments with different crowd sizes with zero retraining. Furthermore, a series of simulated and hardware experiments show that the control policy also works in highly constrained static environments on a different robot platform without any additional training.

10.1016/j.engappai.2023.106197,Event-triggered reconfigurable reinforcement learning motion-planning approach for mobile robot in unknown dynamic environments,"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an essential technique for autonomous motion planning of mobile robots in dynamic and uncertain environments. In attempting to acquire a satisfactory DRL-based motion planning strategy, the mobile robots encountered several difficulties, including poor convergence, insufficient sample information, and low learning efficiency. These problems not only consume plenty of training time, but also bring a negative impact on motion planning performance. One promising research direction is to provide a more effective network framework for DRL-based policies. Along this line of thinking, our paper presents a novel DRL-based motion planning approach called Reconfigurable Structure of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (RS-DDPG) for mobile robots. To account for the poor convergence, the proposed approach first introduces an event-triggered reconfigurable actor–critic network framework for motion policy that adaptively changes its network structure to suppress the overestimation of action value. Then, the time convergence of the motion policy can be enhanced based on the value actions with minor valuation deviation. Afterwards, an adaptive reward mechanism is designed for reconfigurable networks to compensate for the lack of sample information. To deal with the problem of low learning efficiency, we developed a sample pretreatment method for the experience samples, which employs three novel techniques to improve the sample utilization, including a double experience memory buffer, a variable proportional sampling principle, and a similarity judgment mechanism.

10.1016/j.rcim.2023.102538,AL-ProMP: Force-relevant skills learning and generalization method for robotic polishing,"Skill learning in robot polishing is gaining attention and becoming a hot issue. Current studies on skill learning in robot polishing are mainly about trajectory skills, and force-relevant skills learning models are less studied. A skill learning method with good generalization and robustness is one of the elements worth investigating. In this study, a force-relevant skills learning method called arc-length probabilistic movement primitives (AL-ProMP) is proposed to improve the efficiency of robot polishing force planning. AL-ProMP learns the mapping between the contact force and polishing trajectory, and the temporal scaling factor and force scaling factor in AL-ProMP enable better robustness of force planning in speed scaling tasks and polishing tasks in different scenarios. Speed scaling is an important property for adaptation of the polishing policy. For the generalization of polishing skills to different polishing tools in robotics disc polishing tasks of unknown geometric model workpieces, a novel force scaling factor for different polishing discs is proposed according to the contact force model. In addition, polishing contact position learning provides the basis for polishing trajectory generalization.

10.1109/TII.2022.3227634,Fog Node Planning With Stochastic Sensor Traffic in Dynamic Industrial Environment,"The emergence of Industrial Internet of Things along with fog computing (FC) has brought great benefits in the industry field through real-time monitoring, resource optimization configuration, and intelligent cloud control. The deployment of fog nodes in industrial plants is the essential precondition for FC implementation. Existing works are mainly based on pregiven sensor traffic in the deployment of fog nodes, which largely ignores the stochastic uncertainty imposed by the dynamic industrial environment. In this article, without requiring a priori knowledge of the sensor traffic pattern, we establish a mathematical model based on uncertain programming to formulate the fog node location determination and the sensor association problem. Owing to the complexity of the model, we introduce a learning-based algorithm to effectively solve the problem with an acceleration mechanism. Finally, intensive simulations are implemented to verify the performance of the algorithm. The results indicate that our approach outperforms other benchmarks in terms of transmission energy on planning fog nodes in industrial plants with stochastic sensor traffic.",ar,2023-08-01,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,Fog computing (FC) | fog nodes deployment | Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) | stochastic sensor traffic,2-s2.0-85144779297,,,Article,Shao M.,60025578;127905207,Xidian University;Ltd,Xi'an;Ningbo,China;China,5,"Shao, Menghan;Liu, Jiayi;Yang, Qinghai;Shen, Ba Zhong;Wu, Minai",57215204725;55547071100;55473865100;57838469300;58031027600,60025578;60025578;60025578;60025578;127905207,1 August 2023,15513203,144912,19410050,Journal,19,8,,9217-9226,0,NSFC,61971327,National Natural Science Foundation of China,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2022.3227634
10.1007/s12369-022-00942-6,Reducing Computational Cost During Robot Navigation and Human–Robot Interaction with a Human-Inspired Reinforcement Learning Architecture,"We present a new neuro-inspired reinforcement learning architecture for robot online learning and decision-making during both social and non-social scenarios. The goal is to take inspiration from the way humans dynamically and autonomously adapt their behavior according to variations in their own performance while minimizing cognitive effort. Following computational neuroscience principles, the architecture combines model-based (MB) and model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL). The main novelty here consists in arbitrating with a meta-controller which selects the current learning strategy according to a trade-off between efficiency and computational cost. The MB strategy, which builds a model of the long-term effects of actions and uses this model to decide through dynamic programming, enables flexible adaptation to task changes at the expense of high computation costs. The MF strategy is less flexible but also 1000 times less costly, and learns by observation of MB decisions. We test the architecture in three experiments: a navigation task in a real environment with task changes (wall configuration changes, goal location changes); a simulated object manipulation task under human teaching signals; and a simulated human–robot cooperation task to tidy up objects on a table. We show that our human-inspired strategy coordination method enables the robot to maintain an optimal performance in terms of reward and computational cost compared to an MB expert alone, which achieves the best performance but has the highest computational cost. We also show that the method makes it possible to cope with sudden changes in the environment, goal changes or changes in the behavior of the human partner during interaction tasks. The robots that performed these experiments, whether real or virtual, all used the same set of parameters, thus showing the generality of the method.",ar,2023-08-01,International Journal of Social Robotics,Cognitive monitoring | HRI | Navigation | Neuro-inspiration | Reinforcement learning | Robot cognitive architecture | Strategy coordination,2-s2.0-85141567655,,,Article,Dromnelle R.,60069769;60009999;60002947;113883816,Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique;Universität Innsbruck;National Technical University of Athens;Athena Research Center,Paris;Innsbruck;Athens;Marousi,France;Austria;Greece;Greece,7,"Dromnelle, Rémi;Renaudo, Erwan;Chetouani, Mohamed;Maragos, Petros;Chatila, Raja;Girard, Benoît;Khamassi, Mehdi",57211624716;56303861600;8964513700;35243026700;7003451196;36945382400;6508136456,60069769;60009999;60069769;113883816-60002947;60069769;60069769;60069769,August 2023,18754791,19500157063,18754805,Journal,15,8,,1297-1323,0,H2020,ANR-21-CE33-0019-01,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,1,2023,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12369-022-00942-6

However, currently, the performance of AV heavily that relies on the quality of maps and mapless navigation is one potential method for navigation in a strange and dynamic changing environment. Although many efforts are made on mapless navigation, they either need prior knowledge, rely on an exceptional constructed environment or simple feature fusion mechanism in the networks. In this paper, we proposed a deep reinforcement learning method, namely TC-DDPG, which is consisted of DDPG, multi-challenge deep learning networks and time-critical reward function. By comparing to existing approaches, TC-DDPG takes the cost of time into consideration and achieves better performance and converges more easily. A new open source simulator is proposed and extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the TC-DDPG, which outperforms comparing methods and achieves 62.9% less in time cost, 12.0% less in distance cost and about 90% fewer in numbers of model parameters.",ar,2023-08-01,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,DDPG | mapless navigation | path planning | Reinforcement learning | robot motion planning,2-s2.0-85136854910,,,Article,Li B.,60082183;60069734;60021666;60009512;130093618;128511154,Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering;Logistical Engineering University China;Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics;The University of Adelaide;Ministry of Industry and Information Technology;Science and Innovation Base,Guangzhou;Chongqing;Nanjing;Adelaide;Suzhou;Nanjing,China;China;China;Australia;China;China,8,"Li, Bohan;Huang, Zhelong;Chen, Tony Weitong;Dai, Tianlun;Zang, Yalei;Xie, Wenbin;Tian, Bo;Cai, Ken",26026662900;57556910000;57864283300;57211689002;57339896800;53265410500;57864986400;35106610300,60021666-130093618;60021666;60009512;60021666;60021666;60069734;128511154;60082183,1 August 2023,15249050,18378,15580016,Journal,24,8,,8628-8637,0,,undefined,,1,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2022.3192480
10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3124366,Robotic Manipulation in Dynamic Scenarios via Bounding-Box-Based Hindsight Goal Generation,"By relabeling past experience with heuristic or curriculum goals, state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms such as hindsight experience replay (HER), hindsight goal generation (HGG), and graph-based HGG (G-HGG) have been able to solve challenging robotic manipulation tasks in multigoal settings with sparse rewards. HGG outperforms HER in challenging tasks in which goals are difficult to explore by learning from a curriculum, in which intermediate goals are selected based on the Euclidean distance to target goals. G-HGG enhances HGG by selecting intermediate goals from a precomputed graph representation of the environment, which enables its applicability in an environment with stationary obstacles. However, G-HGG is not applicable to manipulation tasks with dynamic obstacles, since its graph representation is only valid in static scenarios and fails to provide any correct information to guide the exploration. In this article, we propose bounding-box-based HGG (Bbox-HGG), an extension of G-HGG selecting hindsight goals with the help of image observations of the environment, which makes it applicable to tasks with dynamic obstacles. We evaluate Bbox-HGG on four challenging manipulation tasks, where significant enhancements in both sample efficiency and overall success rate are shown over state-of-the-art algorithms.

10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3117878,Policy Gradient-Based Core Placement Optimization for Multichip Many-Core Systems,"As many deep neural network models become deeper and more complex, processing devices with stronger computing performance and communication capability are required. Following this trend, the dependence on multichip many-core systems that have high parallelism and reasonable transmission costs is on the rise. In this work, in order to improve routing performance of the system, such as routing runtime and power consumption, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)- based core placement optimization approach, considering application constraints, such as deadlock caused by multicast paths. We leverage the capability of deep RL from indirect supervision as a direct nonlinear optimizer, and the parameters of the policy network are updated by proximal policy optimization. We treat the routing topology as a network graph, so we utilize a graph convolutional network to embed the features into the policy network. One step size environment is designed, so all cores are placed simultaneously. To handle large dimensional action space, we use continuous values matching with the number of cores as the output of the policy network and discretize them again for obtaining the new placement. For multichip system mapping, we developed a community detection algorithm. We use several datasets of multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural networks to evaluate our agent. We compare the optimal results obtained by our agent with other baselines under different multicast conditions. Our approach achieves a significant reduction of routing runtime, communication cost, and average traffic load, along with deadlock-free performance for inner chip data transmission. The traffic of interchip routing is also significantly reduced after integrating the community detection algorithm to our agent.",ar,2023-08-01,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,Community detection algorithm | deadlock-free placement | physical mapping | reinforcement learning (RL),2-s2.0-85117278393,,34644256,Article,Myung W.,60025278,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,5,"Myung, Wooshik;Lee, Donghyun;Song, Chenhang;Wang, Guanrui;Ma, Cheng",57216852746;57915483600;57744661700;57201775278;8914125600,60025278;60025278;60025278;60025278;60025278,1 August 2023,2162237X,21100235616,21622388,Journal,34,8,,4529-4543,0,NKRDPC,2018YFE0200200,National Key Research and Development Program of China,1,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3117878

In Sweden alone, over 400 millions seedlings are planted annually. This work is physically demanding and the quality is uneven. Therefore, automatic production systems are under research and development. A necessary effort in this endeavor is presented in this paper: the development and evaluation of a mission supervisor utilized to control the mission and behavior of a full-scale autonomous forest regeneration machine tested in realistic environments. The mission supervisor is implemented in the Robot Operating System framework using a finite state machine package called SMACH. A terrain machine built as a research platform with an added full-scale forwarder crane is used as a base machine. First, we describe the scenario in which planting is conducted, whereupon we develop the composite tasks required as states. A simplified simulator then enables an intermediate step before field experiments. The system is implemented and operated in real time on a full-scale machine. Results show that the developed SMACH mission supervisor can be used as a sound basis for an autonomous forest regeneration machine and the chosen communication solution between different systems works well. The simulations show good agreement with the experiments. The results also show that crane movements take 70% of the machine time, emphasizing the importance of limiting crane movement, improving the actuator movement speed and integrating the composite solutions.

10.3390/s23146572,In-the-Wild Affect Analysis of Children with ASD Using Heart Rate,"Recognizing the affective state of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in real-world settings poses challenges due to the varying head poses, illumination levels, occlusion and a lack of datasets annotated with emotions in in-the-wild scenarios. Understanding the emotional state of children with ASD is crucial for providing personalized interventions and support. Existing methods often rely on controlled lab environments, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. Hence, a framework that enables the recognition of affective states in children with ASD in uncontrolled settings is needed. This paper presents a framework for recognizing the affective state of children with ASD in an in-the-wild setting using heart rate (HR) information. More specifically, an algorithm is developed that can classify a participant’s emotion as positive, negative, or neutral by analyzing the heart rate signal acquired from a smartwatch. The heart rate data are obtained in real time using a smartwatch application while the child learns to code a robot and interacts with an avatar. The avatar assists the child in developing communication skills and programming the robot. In this paper, we also present a semi-automated annotation technique based on facial expression recognition for the heart rate data. The HR signal is analyzed to extract features that capture the emotional state of the child. Additionally, in this paper, the performance of a raw HR-signal-based emotion classification algorithm is compared with a classification approach based on features extracted from HR signals using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art HR-based emotion recognition techniques, despite being conducted in an uncontrolled setting rather than a controlled lab environment. The framework presented in this paper contributes to the real-world affect analysis of children with ASD using HR information. By enabling emotion recognition in uncontrolled settings, this approach has the potential to improve the monitoring and understanding of the emotional well-being of children with ASD in their daily lives.",ar,2023-07-01,Sensors,autism spectrum disorder (ASD) | emotion recognition | heart rate | smart bracelet | wearable,2-s2.0-85166013964,,37514866,Article,Ali K.,60022144;60020304,"University of Central Florida;University of Maryland, College Park",Orlando;College Park,United States;United States,3,"Ali, Kamran;Shah, Sachin;Hughes, Charles E.",56457652600;58267477200;7401857048,60022144;60022144-60020304;60022144,July 2023,14248220,130124,,Journal,23,14,6572,,1,NSF,2114808,National Science Foundation,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/s23146572

Taking into account several characteristics of robot motion, a multi-objective optimization approach is proposed, which was based on the motivations of deep reinforcement learning and optimal planning. The optimal trajectory was considered with respect to multiple objectives, aiming to minimize factors such as accuracy, energy consumption, and smoothness. The multiple objectives were integrated into the reinforcement learning environment to achieve the desired trajectory. Based on forward and inverse kinematics, the joint angles and Cartesian coordinates were used as the input parameters, while the joint angle estimation served as the output. To enable the environment to rapidly find more-efficient solutions, the decaying episode mechanism was employed throughout the training process. The distribution of the trajectory points was improved in terms of uniformity and smoothness, which greatly contributed to the optimization of the robotic arm’s trajectory.

First, the obstacle avoidance problem is converted into an optimal learning incentive problem, and the self-learning of the obstacle avoidance policy is realized based on DDPG; second, the DWA obstacle avoidance trajectory evaluation function is optimized using the DDPG reward incentive mechanism, and the Experience Replay mechanism; finally, the algorithm model is simulated. The experiments show that the model can significantly circumvent the deficiency of the DWA algorithm in limiting to the optimal local solution in a complex environment and solve the action output problem in the continuous velocity and turning angle value interval of the robot; through the trial and error interaction with the environment and the trajectory evaluation incentive feedback, the obstacle avoidance passing ability of the robot in a complex environment is improved.",ar,2023-07-01,Computers and Electrical Engineering,DDPG | DWA | Obstacle avoidance | Path planning,2-s2.0-85163363169,S0045790623001775,,Article,Wang S.,60073587;60024979,Henan University of Science and Technology;Zhongnan University of Economics and Law,Luoyang;Wuhan,China;China,4,"Wang, Shiqi;Hu, Yiyi;Liu, Zhenni;Ma, Lijun",58135742200;57220549610;58135954500;58136164800,60073587;60024979;60024979;60024979,July 2023,00457906,18159,,Journal,109,,108753,,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compeleceng.2023.108753

This study proposes an improved Q-learning (IQL) algorithm to address the challenges of path planning in such environments. To this end, three different modes are introduced into the IQL algorithm, namely the normal mode, the distortion mode, and the optimization mode. The normal mode operates according to the standard Q-learning procedures. The distortion mode distorts the Q-values of states around dynamic obstacles to facilitate avoidance, while the optimization mode is employed to overcome the local minimum problem. The efficacy of the IQL algorithm is assessed through a series of comparative studies involving fourteen navigation environments, each with distinct obstacle layouts and types. Comparative analyses are performed based on several metrics, including computational time, travelled distance, collision rate, and success rate. The proposed IQL algorithm exhibits a lower collision rate and a higher success rate when compared to dynamic window approach, influence zone and inflated A*.",ar,2023-07-01,Computers and Industrial Engineering,Autonomous mobile robot | Distortion | Dynamic environment | Optimization | Path planning | Q-learning,2-s2.0-85163341192,S0360835223003625,,Article,Low E.S.,60090656,Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia,Batu Pahat,Malaysia,3,"Low, Ee Soong;Ong, Pauline;Low, Cheng Yee",57189377047;57208303533;53868062700,60090656;60090656;60090656,July 2023,03608352,18164,,Journal,181,,109338,,0,MOHE,FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/UTHM/02/2,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia",1,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2023.109338

However, the large dimension of configuration space challenges the real-time performance of existing grasp planning methods and drastically limits the application of anthropomorphic hands. In this letter, we propose a fast force-closure grasp synthesis (FFCGS) method for the anthropomorphic hand to efficiently grasp unknown objects. The FFCGS is implemented by using a signed distance field (SDF) as input. Firstly, a network that samples feasible 6D wrist poses is trained in an end-to-end fashion to reduce the dimension of search space. Furthermore, a fast optimization algorithm is presented to find finger configurations for force-closure precision grasp based on the differentiable Q-distance metric. We validate our method in both a simulated and a real-world environment. Experiment results show that the proposed FFCGS achieves a significantly improved performance in terms of time efficiency (5 times faster), grasp quality metrics, and success rate (5%-10% improvement) over benchmark methods.

State-of-the-art approaches do not consider cues of human-robot-shared dynamic environments. Aiming to fill this gap, we present a novel Human-Flow-Aware Guided Hierarchical Dyna-Q (HA-GHDQ) algorithm, which solves long-term robot task planning problems by using human motion patterns encoded in Maps of Dynamics (MoDs). To tackle the complexity of long-term robot operation in dynamic environments, we propose a combination of symbolic planning and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) that generates robot policies considering cost information derived from MoDs. We evaluated HA-GHDQ in a factory environment with two simulation and one real-world datasets to complete a transportation-and-assembly task.

10.1109/LRA.2023.3280809,Learning to Play Trajectory Games Against Opponents with Unknown Objectives,"Many autonomous agents, such as intelligent vehicles, are inherently required to interact with one another. Game theory provides a natural mathematical tool for robot motion planning in such interactive settings. However, tractable algorithms for such problems usually rely on a strong assumption, namely that the objectives of all players in the scene are known. To make such tools applicable for ego-centric planning with only local information, we propose an adaptive model-predictive game solver, which jointly infers other players' objectives online and computes a corresponding generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) strategy. The adaptivity of our approach is enabled by a differentiable trajectory game solver whose gradient signal is used for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of opponents' objectives. This differentiability of our pipeline facilitates direct integration with other differentiable elements, such as neural networks (NNs). Furthermore, in contrast to existing solvers for cost inference in games, our method handles not only partial state observations but also general inequality constraints. In two simulated traffic scenarios, we find superior performance of our approach over both existing game-theoretic methods and non-game-theoretic model-predictive control (MPC) approaches.

10.1016/j.robot.2023.104428,Automatic extension of a symbolic mobile manipulation skill set,"Symbolic planning can provide an intuitive interface for non-expert users to operate autonomous robots by abstracting away much of the low-level programming. However, symbolic planners assume that the initially provided abstract domain and problem descriptions are closed and complete. This means that they are fundamentally unable to adapt to changes in the environment or tasks that are not captured by the initial description. We propose a method that allows an agent to automatically extend the abstract description of its skill set upon encountering such a situation. We introduce strategies for generalizing from previous experience, completing sequences of key actions and discovering preconditions to ensure computational efficiency. The resulting system is evaluated on a symbolic planning benchmark task and on object rearrangement tasks in simulation.

To assure safety and predictability, these artificial agents should act in accordance with the applicable social norms. However, it is not straightforward to define these rules and incorporate them in an agent’s policy. Particularly because social norms are often implicit and environment specific. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative approach to extract a set of rules from observed human trajectories. This hybrid method combines the strengths of inverse reinforcement learning and inductive logic programming. We experimentally show how our method successfully induces a compact logic program which represents the behavioral constraints applicable in a Tower of Hanoi and a traffic simulator environment. The induced program is adopted as prior knowledge by a model-free reinforcement learning agent to speed up training and prevent any social norm violation during exploration and deployment. Moreover, expressing norms as a logic program provides improved interpretability, which is an important pillar in the design of safe artificial agents, as well as transferability to similar environments.",ar,2023-07-01,Machine Learning,Answer set programming | Constrained Markov decision process | Constraint inference | Inductive logic programming | Inverse reinforcement learning,2-s2.0-85149869694,,,Article,Baert M.,60033316,Universiteit Gent,Ghent,Belgium,3,"Baert, Mattijs;Leroux, Sam;Simoens, Pieter",57222091867;57014915400;13104080000,60033316;60033316;60033316,July 2023,08856125,24775,15730565,Journal,112,7,,2593-2618,0,ILVO,174U01222,Vlaamse Overheid,1,2023,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-023-06311-2
10.1109/TASE.2023.3236805,Deep Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Assembly Planning in Robot-Based Prefabricated Construction,"The adoption of robotics is promising to improve the efficiency, quality, and safety of prefabricated construction. Besides technologies that improve the capability of a single robot, the automated assembly planning for robots at construction sites is vital for further improving the efficiency and promoting robots into practices. However, considering the highly dynamic and uncertain nature of a construction environment, and the varied scenarios in different construction sites, it is always challenging to make appropriate and up-to-date assembly plans. Therefore, this paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based method for automated assembly planning in robot-based prefabricated construction. Specifically, a re-configurable simulator for assembly planning is developed based on a Building Information Model (BIM) and an open game engine, which could support the training and testing of various optimization methods. Furthermore, the assembly planning problem is modelled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and a set of DRL algorithms are developed and trained using the simulator. Finally, experimental case studies in four typical scenarios are conducted, and the performance of our proposed methods have been verified, which can also serve as benchmarks for future research works within the community of automated construction. Note to Practitioners - This paper is conducted based on the comprehensive analysis of real-life assembly planning processes in prefabricated construction, and the methods proposed could bring many benefits to practitioners. Firstly, the proposed simulator could be easily re-configured to simulate diverse scenarios, which can be used to evaluate and verify the operations' optimization methods and new construction technologies. Secondly, the proposed DRL-based optimization methods can be directly adopted in various robot-based construction scenarios, and can also be tailored to support the assembly planning in traditional human-based or human-robot construction environments.

10.1007/s10639-022-11491-w,A review of AI teaching and learning from 2000 to 2020,"In recent years, with the popularity of AI technologies in our everyday life, researchers have begun to discuss an emerging term “AI literacy”. However, there is a lack of review to understand how AI teaching and learning (AITL) research looks like over the past two decades to provide the research basis for AI literacy education. To summarize the empirical findings from the literature, this systematic literature review conducts a thematic and content analysis of 49 publications from 2000 to 2020 to pave the way for recent AI literacy education. The related pedagogical models, teaching tools and challenges identified help set the stage for today’s AI literacy. The results show that AITL focused more on computer science education at the university level before 2021. Teaching AI had not become popular in K-12 classrooms at that time due to a lack of age-appropriate teaching tools for scaffolding support. However, the pedagogies learnt from the review are valuable for educators to reflect how they should develop students’ AI literacy today. Educators have adopted collaborative project-based learning approaches, featuring activities like software development, problem-solving, tinkering with robots, and using game elements. However, most of the activities require programming prerequisites and are not ready to scaffold students’ AI understandings. With suitable teaching tools and pedagogical support in recent years, teaching AI shifts from technology-oriented to interdisciplinary design. Moreover, global initiatives have started to include AI literacy in the latest educational standards and strategic initiatives. These findings provide a research foundation to inform educators and researchers the growth of AI literacy education that can help them to design pedagogical strategies and curricula that use suitable technologies to better prepare students to become responsible educated citizens for today’s growing AI economy.",ar,2023-07-01,Education and Information Technologies,AI literacy | AI teaching and learning | Pedagogy | Systematic review | Teaching tools,2-s2.0-85144523072,,,Article,Ng D.T.K.,60006541;60005510;60000745,The University of Hong Kong;Nanyang Technological University;University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,Hong Kong;Singapore City;Urbana,Hong Kong;Singapore;United States,6,"Ng, Davy Tsz Kit;Lee, Min;Tan, Roy Jun Yi;Hu, Xiao;Downie, J.

10.1109/TASE.2022.3217468,Rule-Based Safe Probabilistic Movement Primitive Control via Control Barrier Functions,"In this paper, we develop a novel and safe control design approach that takes demonstrations provided by a human teacher to enable a robot to accomplish complex manipulation scenarios in dynamic environments. First, an overall task is divided into multiple simpler subtasks that are more appropriate for learning and control objectives. Then, by collecting human demonstrations, the subtasks that require robot movement are modeled by probabilistic movement primitives (ProMPs). We also study two strategies for modifying the ProMPs to avoid collisions with environmental obstacles. Finally, we introduce a rule-base control technique by utilizing a finite-state machine along with a unique means of control design for ProMPs. For the ProMP controller, we propose control barrier and Lyapunov functions to guide the system along a trajectory within the distribution defined by a ProMP while guaranteeing that the system state never leaves more than a desired distance from the distribution mean. This allows for better performance on nonlinear systems and offers solid stability and known bounds on the system state. A series of simulations and experimental studies demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and show that it can run in real time. Note to Practitioners - This paper is motivated by the need to create a teach-by-demonstration framework that captures the strengths of movement primitives and verifiable, safe control. We provide a framework that learns safe control laws from a probability distribution of robot trajectories through the use of advanced nonlinear control that incorporates safety constraints. Typically, such distributions are stochastic, making it difficult to offer any guarantees on safe operation. Our approach ensures that the distribution of allowed robot trajectories is within an envelope of safety and allows for robust operation of a robot. Furthermore, using our framework various probability distributions can be combined to represent complex scenarios in the environment. It will benefit practitioners by making it substantially easier to test and deploy accurate, efficient, and safe robots in complex real-world scenarios.

10.1109/TASE.2022.3184458,Interleaved Predictive Control and Planning for an Unmanned Aerial Manipulator with on-the-Fly Rapid Re-Planning in Unknown Environments,"Unmanned Aerial Manipulators (UAM) are gaining attention within the unmanned aerial systems research community. They can be used for aerial manipulation tasks such as object retrieval from confined and hard-to-reach spaces. The coupled dynamics between the arm and the base and also the limited flight time would require the development and implementation of optimal motion planning and robust flight control strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel integrated planning and control strategy for object retrieval. A new kinodynamic version of the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT∗), called Lazy-Steering-RRT∗, is developed for planning UAM's motion from its start to a pre-grasp state, while keeping the motion of the arm to a minimum. This planning can be carried out on the fly by using Machine-Learning-based techniques to construct the edges in the search tree in a time-efficient way. This facilitates re-planning, as the environment is gradually sensed by limited-range sensors onboard. Once the UAM reaches the pre-grasp state at the end of the motion cycle, an RRT approach is then utilized, where motions of the base and the arm are coordinated for reaching and grasping the object. A novel partitioned control approach, composed of model predictive and PID controllers, is utilized for the UAM to track the planned trajectory. The overall motion planning and control algorithms have been implemented in simulation using Multibody Physics Engines and a number of representative simulation runs are presented. Our results show that the approach is effective in successfully executing the object retrieval task even in confined spaces. Note to Practitioners-This research was motivated by the problem of retrieving an object from a confined space such as that in a collapsed building using an unmanned aerial manipulator. Our approach has the following advantages over existing methods: a) Planning and re-planning can be carried out on the fly, b) No prior information about the environment is needed, c) High-frequency energy-optimal control of the UAM is carried out, and d) the planner and the controller are coupled. In this paper, we suggest some novel approaches on both planning and control aspects of the navigation and also on the integration of these two modules to provide a navigation package that meets all the requirements in the retrieval task. Furthermore, our algorithm is computationally-light, therefore, well suited for on the fly planning and control.",ar,2023-07-01,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Autonomous aerial manipulators | model predictive control | motion planning | object rertieval,2-s2.0-85135735839,,,Article,Yavari M.,60030101;60018491,University of Regina;Simon Fraser University,Regina;Burnaby,Canada;Canada,3,"Yavari, Mohammadreza;Gupta, Kamal;Mehrandezh, Mehran",57203984238;35588009200;6601997156,60018491;60018491;60030101,1 July 2023,15455955,17340,15583783,Journal,20,3,,1690-1705,0,,undefined,,1,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2022.3184458
10.1109/TASE.2022.3190901,Intelligent Path Planning of Underwater Robot Based on Reinforcement Learning,"As one of the commonly used vehicles for underwater detection, underwater robots are facing a series of problems. The real underwater environment is large-scale, complex, real-time and dynamic, and many unknown obstacles may exist in the underwater environment. Under such complex conditions and lack of prior knowledge, the existing path planning methods are difficult to plan, therefore they cannot effectively meet the actual demands. In response to these problems, a three-dimensional marine environment including multiple obstacles is established with the real ocean current data in this paper, which is consistent with the actual application scenarios. Then, we propose an N-step Priority Double DQN (NPDDQN) path planning algorithm, which potently realizes obstacle avoidance in the complex environment. In addition, this study proposes an experience screening mechanism, which screens the explored positive experience and improves its reuse rate, thus efficiently improving the algorithm stability in the dynamic environment. This paper verifies the better performance of reinforcement learning compared with a variety of traditional methods in three-dimensional underwater path planning. Underwater robots based on the proposed method have good autonomy and stability, which provides a new method for path planning of underwater robots. Note to Practitioners-The goal of this study is to provide a new solution for obstacle avoidance in path planning of underwater robots, which is consistent with the dynamic and real-time demands of the real environment. Existing underwater path planning researches lack a consistent environment with the actual application, and therefore we firstly construct a three-dimensional ocean environment with real ocean current data to provide support for the algorithms. Additionally, most of the algorithms are pre-planning methods or require long-time calculation, and there is little research on obstacle avoidance. In the face of obstacle changes, underwater robots with poor adaptability will cause performance decline and even economic losses. The proposed algorithm learns through interaction with the environment, and therefore it does not require any prior experience, and has good adaptability as well as fast inference speed. Especially, in the dynamic environment, algorithm performance is difficult to guarantee due to less positive experience in exploration.

10.1109/TASE.2022.3185679,Spatial Iterative Learning Control With Human Guidance and Visual Detection for Path Learning and Tracking,"A popular path learning method is to use off-line programming by demonstration (PbD) to plan a rough path, but it is subjected to uncertainties in the environment so needs to be updated during the task execution. For this purpose, a spatial iterative learning control (sILC) is developed to learn an accurate path through intuitive online correction based on human-robot interaction (HRI). To improve the efficiency and accuracy of the path learning, a visual assistance system is added to HRI, which helps the robot to find the initial path point and complement the correction of the learning error. This method mitigates the requirement on classic ILC that the time period should be consistent in the repetitive interaction task and utilizes the complementary advantages of vision and force sensing, thus addressing the limitations of the vision-based or HRI methods. The rigorous proof of learning convergence and the results of the simulation and experiments on a 7-degree-of-freedom (DoF) Sawyer robot platform illustrate the significance and advantages of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners - The problem of accurate path learning of robotic manipulators is addressed in this paper, which is found in ample applications such as welding and laser cutting. When the required path is irregular, it is difficult to define it based on offline programming and calibration. This paper presents a new human-robot interactive learning framework, in which the interaction force and machine vision are combined with sILC to achieve online detection and correction for learning and tracking an unknown path. This framework leads to an intuitive human-robot collaboration system where the human operator can fine tune the robot's motion through direct physical interaction, and at the same time the robot improves its tracking performance automatically based on visual servoing.",ar,2023-07-01,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Human-robot interaction (HRI) | path learning | spatial iterative learning control (sILC) | visual assistance system,2-s2.0-85133742326,,,Article,Xia J.,60017317;60010421,University of Sussex;Southwest Jiaotong University,Brighton;Chengdu,United Kingdom;China,6,"Xia, Jingkang;Li, Yanan;Huang, Deqing;Yang, Jinlong;Xing, Xueyan;Ma, Lei",57215967067;35174564100;57226719526;57792811600;57200375795;55720948900,60010421;60017317;60010421;60010421;60017317;60010421,1 July 2023,15455955,17340,15583783,Journal,20,3,,1772-1784,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2022.3185679
10.1107/S2053273323001948,Crystal search - feasibility study of a real-time deep learning process for crystallization well images,"To avoid the time-consuming and often monotonous task of manual inspection of crystallization plates, a Python-based program to automatically detect crystals in crystallization wells employing deep learning techniques was developed. The program uses manually scored crystallization trials deposited in a database of an in-house crystallization robot as a training set. Since the success rate of such a system is able to catch up with manual inspection by trained persons, it will become an important tool for crystallographers working on biological samples. Four network architectures were compared and the SqueezeNet architecture performed best. In detecting crystals AlexNet accomplished a better result, but with a lower threshold the mean value for crystal detection was improved for SqueezeNet. Two assumptions were made about the imaging rate. With these two extremes it was found that an image processing rate of at least two times, but up to 58 times in the worst case, would be needed to reach the maximum imaging rate according to the deep learning network architecture employed for real-time classification. To avoid high workloads for the control computer of the CrystalMation system, the computing is distributed over several workstations, participating voluntarily, by the grid programming system from the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC). The outcome of the program is redistributed into the database as automatic real-time scores (ARTscore). These are immediately visible as colored frames around each crystallization well image of the inspection program. In addition, regions of droplets with the highest scoring probability found by the system are also available as images.",ar,2023-06-02,Acta Crystallographica Section A: Foundations and Advances,AlexNet | biocrystallization | BOINC | deep learning | high-throughput screening | neural network | ResNet | SqueezeNet | U-Net | VggNet,2-s2.0-85164209218,S2053273323001948,37265048,Article,Thielmann Y.,60020952;129935417,Max Planck Institute of Biophysics;Systrade GmbH,Frankfurt am Main;Frankfurt am Main,Germany;Germany,4,"Thielmann, Yvonne;Luft, Thorsten;Zint, Norbert;Koepke, Juergen",24478848900;58477104000;58477253100;7101895545,60020952;129935417;60020952;60020952,2 June 2023,,21100326898,20532733,Journal,79,,,331-338,1,MPG,undefined,Max-Planck-Gesellschaft,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053273323001948
10.3390/s23125622,Improved Robot Path Planning Method Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning,"With the advancement of robotics, the field of path planning is currently experiencing a period of prosperity. Researchers strive to address this nonlinear problem and have achieved remarkable results through the implementation of the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm DQN (Deep Q-Network). However, persistent challenges remain, including the curse of dimensionality, difficulties of model convergence and sparsity in rewards. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes an enhanced DDQN (Double DQN) path planning approach, in which the information after dimensionality reduction is fed into a two-branch network that incorporates expert knowledge and an optimized reward function to guide the training process. The data generated during the training phase are initially discretized into corresponding low-dimensional spaces. An “expert experience” module is introduced to facilitate the model’s early-stage training acceleration in the Epsilon–Greedy algorithm. To tackle navigation and obstacle avoidance separately, a dual-branch network structure is presented. We further optimize the reward function enabling intelligent agents to receive prompt feedback from the environment after performing each action. Experiments conducted in both virtual and real-world environments have demonstrated that the enhanced algorithm can accelerate model convergence, improve training stability and generate a smooth, shorter and collision-free path.",ar,2023-06-01,Sensors,DDQN | deep reinforcement learning | expert experience | robot path planning,2-s2.0-85164035357,,37420785,Article,Han H.,60001305;129839238;129839096,North University of China;Shanxi Key Laboratory of Machine Vision and Virtual Reality;Shanxi Vision Information Processing and Intelligent Robot Engineering Research Center,Taiyuan;Taiyuan;Taiyuan,China;China;China,5,"Han, Huiyan;Wang, Jiaqi;Kuang, Liqun;Han, Xie;Xue, Hongxin",55326244800;58450189000;35728744800;58450892400;57197874529,60001305-129839238-129839096;60001305-129839238-129839096;60001305-129839238-129839096;60001305-129839238-129839096;60001305-129839238-129839096,June 2023,14248220,130124,,Journal,23,12,5622,,1,NSFC,447-110103,National Natural Science Foundation of China,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/s23125622
10.3390/biomimetics8020248,Robot Programming from Fish Demonstrations,"Fish are capable of learning complex relations found in their surroundings, and harnessing their knowledge may help to improve the autonomy and adaptability of robots. Here, we propose a novel learning from demonstration framework to generate fish-inspired robot control programs with as little human intervention as possible. The framework consists of six core modules: (1) task demonstration, (2) fish tracking, (3) analysis of fish trajectories, (4) acquisition of robot training data, (5) generating a perception–action controller, and (6) performance evaluation. We first describe these modules and highlight the key challenges pertaining to each one. We then present an artificial neural network for automatic fish tracking. The network detected fish successfully in 85% of the frames, and in these frames, its average pose estimation error was less than 0.04 body lengths. We finally demonstrate how the framework works through a case study focusing on a cue-based navigation task. Two low-level perception–action controllers were generated through the framework. Their performance was measured using two-dimensional particle simulations and compared against two benchmark controllers, which were programmed manually by a researcher. The fish-inspired controllers had excellent performance when the robot was started from the initial conditions used in fish demonstrations (>96% success rate), outperforming the benchmark controllers by at least 3%. One of them also had an excellent generalisation performance when the robot was started from random initial conditions covering a wider range of starting positions and heading angles (>98% success rate), again outperforming the benchmark controllers by 12%. The positive results highlight the utility of the framework as a research tool to form biological hypotheses on how fish navigate in complex environments and design better robot controllers on the basis of biological findings.",ar,2023-06-01,Biomimetics,ANN controller | bio-inspired robotics | fuzzy controller | learning from demonstration | robot programming,2-s2.0-85163883449,,,Article,Coppola C.M.,60030514,Aberystwyth University,Aberystwyth,United Kingdom,5,"Coppola, Claudio Massimo;Strong, James Bradley;O’Reilly, Lissa;Dalesman, Sarah;Akanyeti, Otar",58417706100;58420387000;58419045300;12789303100;19337212200,60030514;60030514;60030514;60030514;60030514,June 2023,,21100944489,23137673,Journal,8,2,248,,1,EC,873178,European Commission,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/biomimetics8020248

Technology supports the learning process by providing useful tools that enrich the learning environment, encourage active participation, improve collaboration and prepare students for their future life. Educational Robotics is one of the most popular innovative methodologies that supports the development of many skills by assembling and programming robots in a meaningful way. In this paper, the authors aim at advancing their previous work in the field of Educational Robotics applied to the marine environment by proposing a novel bioinspired educational toolkit whose design and features support activities concerning sustainability, ocean literacy, as well as STEM subjects in kindergarten through to grade twelve education. Exploiting the established educational theories and methodologies underpinning Educational Robotics, the toolkit allows for marine-themed activities, as well promoting activities concerning STEM subjects. To explain the relevance of the toolkit, the authors present the robot design, the workshops that every teacher or student can explore as an Open Educational Resource (OERs), and the results of a case study.

10.3390/s23115159,Kinesthetic Feedback for Understanding Program Execution,"To better prepare future generations, knowledge about computers and programming are one of the many skills that are part of almost all Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematic programs; however, teaching and learning programming is a complex task that is generally considered difficult by students and teachers alike. One approach to engage and inspire students from a variety of backgrounds is the use of educational robots. Unfortunately, previous research presents mixed results on the effectiveness of educational robots on student learning. One possibility for this lack of clarity may be because students have a wide variety of styles of learning. It is possible that the use of kinesthetic feedback, in addition to the normally used visual feedback, may improve learning with educational robots by providing a richer, multi-modal experience that may appeal to a larger number of students with different learning styles. It is also possible, however, that the addition of kinesthetic feedback, and how it may interfere with the visual feedback, may decrease a student’s ability to interpret the program commands being executed by a robot, which is critical for program debugging. In this work, we investigated whether human participants were able to accurately determine a sequence of program commands performed by a robot when both kinesthetic and visual feedback were being used together. Command recall and end point location determination were compared to the typically used visual-only method, as well as a narrative description. Results from 10 sighted participants indicated that individuals were able to accurately determine a sequence of movement commands and their magnitude when using combined kinesthetic + visual feedback. Participants’ recall accuracy of program commands was actually better with kinesthetic + visual feedback than just visual feedback. Although the recall accuracy was even better with the narrative description, this was primarily due to participants confusing an absolute rotation command with a relative rotation command with the kinesthetic + visual feedback. Participants’ zone location accuracy of the end point after a command was executed was significantly better for both the kinesthetic + visual feedback and narrative methods compared to the visual-only method. Together, these results suggest that the use of both kinesthetic + visual feedback improves an individual’s ability to interpret program commands, rather than decreases it.",ar,2023-06-01,Sensors,programing | robotics | scratch | visually impaired users,2-s2.0-85161574198,,37299886,Article,Gill S.,60002476,Virginia Commonwealth University,Richmond,United States,3,"Gill, Satinder;Goolsby, Bryson J.;Pawluk, Dianne T.V.",55356634400;57223390161;57765699800,60002476;60002476;60002476,June 2023,14248220,130124,,Journal,23,11,5159,,1,NSF,1742242,National Science Foundation,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/s23115159

Recent deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approaches to crowd navigation have yielded numerous promising applications. However, they rely heavily on initial imitation learning and colossal positive datasets. Moreover, the difficulties in accurately localizing robots, detecting and tracking humans, representing and generalizing reciprocal human relationships restrict their deployment in real-world problems. We propose a Dreamer-based motion planner for collision-free navigation in diverse pedestrian scenarios. Our RL framework can completely learn from zero experience via a model-based DRL. The robot and humans are first projected onto a map, which is subsequently decoded into low-dimensional latent state. A predictive dynamic model in the latent space is jointly created to efficiently optimize the navigation policy.

Reactive, predictive, and learning-based methods are widely used in local planning. However, few of them can fit static and crowd environments while satisfying kinodynamic constraints simultaneously. To solve this problem, we propose a novel local planning method. The method applies a long-term dynamic window approach to generate an initial trajectory and then optimizes it with graph optimization.

10.1109/LRA.2023.3265893,ERRA: An Embodied Representation and Reasoning Architecture for Long-Horizon Language-Conditioned Manipulation Tasks,"This letter introduces ERRA, an embodied learning architecture that enables robots to jointly obtain three fundamental capabilities (reasoning, planning, and interaction) for solving long-horizon language-conditioned manipulation tasks. ERRA is based on tightly-coupled probabilistic inferences at two granularity levels. Coarse-resolution inference is formulated as sequence generation through a large language model, which infers action language from natural language instruction and environment state. The robot then zooms to the fine-resolution inference part to perform the concrete action corresponding to the action language. Fine-resolution inference is constructed as a Markov decision process, which takes action language and environmental sensing as observations and outputs the action. The results of action execution in environments provide feedback for subsequent coarse-resolution reasoning. Such coarse-to-fine inference allows the robot to decompose and achieve long-horizon tasks interactively. In extensive experiments, we show that ERRA can complete various long-horizon manipulation tasks specified by abstract language instructions. We also demonstrate successful generalization to the novel but similar natural language instructions.",ar,2023-06-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,human-robot interaction | large language model (LLM) | Manipulation | reasoning | reinforcement learning,2-s2.0-85153351346,,,Article,Zhao C.,60019578;60008592;126660620,Monash University;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;HKUST Shenzhen-Hong Kong Collaborative Innovation Research Institute,Melbourne;Hong Kong;Shenzhen,Australia;Hong Kong;China,7,"Zhao, Chao;Yuan, Shuai;Jiang, Chunli;Cai, Junhao;Yu, Hongyu;Wang, Michael Yu;Chen, Qifeng",57219527362;58194130200;57215560794;57234393000;8982289700;54959897800;55365826000,60008592;60008592;60008592;60008592-126660620;60008592-126660620;126660620-60019578;60008592,1 June 2023,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,8,6,,3230-3237,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2023.3265893

A key question of cognition-enabled and AI-driven robotics is how to organize and manage such data and knowledge efficiently in a cognitive robot control architecture. We argue, that memory is a central active component of such architectures that mediates between semantic and sensorimotor representations, orchestrates the flow of data streams and events between different processes and provides the components of a cognitive architecture with data-driven services for learning semantics from sensorimotor data, the parametrization of symbolic plans for execution and prediction of action effects. Based on related work, and the experience gained in developing our ARMAR humanoid robot systems, we identified conceptual and technical requirements of a memory system as central component of cognitive robot control architecture that facilitate the realization of high-level cognitive abilities such as explaining, reasoning, prospection, simulation and augmentation. Conceptually, a memory should be active, support multi-modal data representations, associate knowledge, be introspective, and have an inherently episodic structure. Technically, the memory should support a distributed design, be access-efficient and capable of long-term data storage.

10.1109/LRA.2023.3261759,Geometric-Feature Representation Based Pre-Training Method for Reinforcement Learning of Peg-in-Hole Tasks,"Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) is often used for learning the strategy of peg-in-hole tasks. However, traditional state representation of PiH RL might be either redundant or abstract, which leads to unnecessary learning steps and incompatibility with mathematical training optimization. To issue these problems, a geometric-feature (GF) state representation method for peg-in-hole DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) RL is proposed to get rid of the redundant states. Also, a network pre-training method for peg-in-hole DDPG based on GF representation is provided to help DDPG acquire basic assembly skills before training. Finally, we executed the simulation experiments in the environment with Open AI Gym + Pybullet to test the performance of the proposed GF representation based pre-training method. We also executed the lenrned strategy on the real-world Panda robot.",ar,2023-06-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,assembly | contact modeling | Reinforcement learning | task planning,2-s2.0-85151516678,,,Article,Zang Y.,60019616,Harbin Institute of Technology,Harbin,China,6,"Zang, Yajing;Wang, Pengfei;Zha, Fusheng;Guo, Wei;Ruan, Songlin;Sun, Lining",57227753500;56168378800;24538206500;56527568700;58169691800;57204292698,60019616;60019616;60019616;60019616;60019616;60019616,1 June 2023,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,8,6,,3478-3485,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2023.3261759
10.1016/j.asoc.2023.110236,Chaos-based optimal path planning of humanoid robot using hybridized regression-gravity search algorithm in static and dynamic terrains,"The present work deals with the navigational analysis of humanoids in complex terrains by tuning the classical approach with reactive techniques. Here, the linear regression (LR)-based classical approach is merged with the gravitational search algorithm (GSA), called RGSA, and Chaos is added to achieve an optimum path. To improve upon the local traps, Chaos is introduced into the basic structure of the RGSA model to attain a global solution without effecting the higher convergence rate of the RGSA model. The Chaos further adds ergodicity to the dynamical system, gaining an optimal path length in the shortest time possible. The use of the proposed hybridization technique is found to be effective as compared to its counterparts. Various chaotic maps like the logistic map, Gauss map, piecewise linear chaotic map, and sinusoidal maps are used, and the results are compared. Also, the smoothness of the path is ensured during trajectory planning. The analysis is done in real-time lab conditions and simulation environments using single and multiple humanoids (Nao robots) with static and dynamic obstacles within the search space. The simulation for the path planning is done using the Webot software, while the choregraphe software is used for experimental path planning. The simulation and experimental work presented in the current paper shows good agreement and are within 6% acceptable limits. The proposed controller is then compared with a vision-based approach and another parallel sensor-based approach for optimum operational cost and smoother trajectory. The current work is a novel approach in which the humanoid's interaction with the mobile robot is also analyzed. The proposed approach successfully avoided the dynamic obstacle in the form of the KHEPERA-II mobile robot. This concept can find potential applications in soccer scenarios employing mobile robots as opponent players to the Nao robots. Further, because of the lower operational cost, the proposed methodology can also be applied to other areas, such as multitasking, cooperative scheduling, power distribution systems, etc.",ar,2023-06-01,Applied Soft Computing,C-RGSA | Humanoid robot | Hybrid techniques | Nao | Path planning | Webot,2-s2.0-85151504964,S1568494623002545,,Article,Vikas ,60000934,National Institute of Technology Rourkela,Rourkela,India,2,"Vikas, ;Parhi, Dayal R.",57653604900;6603245659,60000934;60000934,June 2023,15684946,18136,,Journal,140,,110236,,0,,undefined,,3,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2023.110236

This paper presents an analysis of the way in which children describe programming concepts and their use of spontaneous co-speech gestures. We conducted two interviews at two different times (one directly after a programming activity, and one approximately two weeks later) with 45 primary school students in Saudi Arabia (aged 6 to 7). We analysed their responses when asked to explain two programming concepts: program and iteration. Participants using metaphorical gestures drew upon two overarching embodied metaphors in their explanations, namely (i) computing constructs as physical objects (ii) computing processes as a motion along the path. Participants moved their hands along one of three body-based axes (longitudinal, transverse, and frontal) when referring to chronological sequences. These findings were broadly in keeping with those found in previous work on University computing students’ gestures. However, our study also showed that gestures used by child learners whose first language is a right-to-left language (i.e., Arabic) had directional differences compared to the gestures used by adult learners whose first language is a left-to-right language (e.g., English).

10.1111/jcal.12778,Scratch versus LEGO robots: Which engages undergraduates more in programming education?,"Background: Being easy to learn and fun, block-based programming tools are widely used to teach students introductory programming. Scratch and LEGO robots are two popular block-based programming tools. However, the objects they manipulate are completely different. Scratch manipulates graphical virtual sprites, whereas LEGO robots manipulate physical robots. Different manipulating objects may bring students varied learning experiences. Objectives: This study compared undergraduate students' learning engagement and flow experience when programming on Scratch and LEGO robots. Methods: The study was conducted in a programming course which involved 28 Chinese undergraduates. At the end of the 14-week course, all students were requested to complete the questionnaire twice, one for their perceptions of Scratch and the other for those of LEGO robotics. Three semi-structured focus-group interviews were also conducted for students' perceptions of the course. Results and Conclusions: The results showed that LEGO robots scored significantly higher on behavioural and emotional engagement, while cognitive engagement was not significantly different. As for the flow experience, Scratch provided students with a greater sense of control, while LEGO robots allowed students to experience temporal distortion. There were no significant differences in terms of clear goals and immediate feedback.

These rewards differ from the traditional sparse reward. First, a posture reward function is proposed to speed up the learning process with a more reasonable trajectory by modeling the distance and direction constraints, which can reduce the blindness of exploration. Second, a stride reward function is proposed to improve the stability of the learning process by modeling the distance and movement distance of joint constraints. Finally, in order to further improve learning efficiency, we are inspired by the cognitive process of human behavior and propose a stage incentive mechanism, including a hard-stage incentive reward function and a soft-stage incentive reward function.

Currently, the majority of these sealing tasks are performed by human workers. Hence, they are susceptible to labor shortage problems. The use of vision-guided robotic systems is a feasible alternative to automate these types of repetitive and tedious manipulation tasks. In this paper, we present the development of a new method to automate silicone sealing with robotic manipulators. To this end, we propose a novel neural path planning framework that leverages fractional-order differentiation for robust seam detection with vision and a Riemannian motion policy for effectively learning the manipulation of a sealing gun. Optimal control commands can be computed analytically by designing a deep neural network that predicts the acceleration and associated Riemannian metric of the sealing gun from feedback signals. The performance of our new methodology is experimentally validated with a robotic platform conducting multiple silicone sealing tasks in unstructured situations. The reported results demonstrate that compared with directly predicting the control commands, our neural path planner achieves a more generalizable performance on unseen workpieces and is more robust to human/environment disturbances.",ar,2023-06-01,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,Neural path planning | Reactive path planning | Riemannian motion policy | Robotic sealing | Seam detection,2-s2.0-85145661513,S0736584522002009,,Article,Zhou P.,60019616;60008928,Harbin Institute of Technology;The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Harbin;Hong Kong,China;Hong Kong,8,"Zhou, Peng;Zheng, Pai;Qi, Jiaming;Li, Chengxi;Duan, Anqing;Xu, Maggie;Wu, Victor;Navarro-Alarcon, David",57221249034;56352424300;57220580396;57226701156;57207208557;57221254711;57219625803;25925269700,60008928;60008928;60019616;60008928;60008928;60008928;60008928;60008928,June 2023,07365845,18080,,Journal,81,,102518,,0,,BBV8,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcim.2022.102518

The system can detect the contact state of the hand-robot joint and extracts motion intention information from the human surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to control the robot's motion. First, a hand-robot contact state detection method is proposed based on the fusion of the virtual robot environment with the physical environment. With the use of a target detection algorithm, the position of the human hand in the color image of the physical environment can be identified and its pixel coordinates can be calculated. Meanwhile, the synthetic images of the virtual robot environment are combined with those of the physical robot scene to determine whether the human hand is in contact with the robot. Besides, a human motion intention recognition model based on deep learning is designed to recognize human motion intention with the input of sEMG signals. Moreover, a robot motion mode selection module is built to control the robot for single-axis motion, linear motion, or repositioning motion by combining the hand-robot contact state and human motion intention.

SRA-programming has been identified as an instrumental way of thinking for learning to program robots and encourages the development of the more complex concepts of programming. Visual programming environments are diverse in appearance and prove to be an excellent way to teach pupils the basic ideas of programming. It is important to investigate whether the type of output has a characteristic influence on the level of development of CT in visual programming environments. In this research, we therefore explore whether characteristic differences in the development of CT can be measured when SRA-programming is applied in a visual programming environment with an on-screen output or a tangible output. It was expected that the observed effect of pupils' programming actions through the application of SRA would show that the type of output influences the understanding of complex programming concepts at a higher level.

Our hypothesis is that, in face of large systemic uncertainties, learning control policies from human demonstrations may offer a pathway to spacecraft guidance solutions that are more generalizable and complementary of baseline-dependent methods. In this context, the performance discrepancy between spacecraft path-planning policies trained from human demonstrations and optimal baseline solutions has not been characterized. We define a low-thrust, minimum-time transfer problem with predefined boundary constraints, across a wide range of binary asteroid systems, which form a “sandbox” environment for complex, highly variable, and poorly known orbit environments. Trajectories generated using optimal control theory (both indirect and direct methods) and human demonstrations (from a gamified version of the baseline environment) are collected. We test different implementations of behavioral cloning to analyze both feed forward and stateless long short-term memory regressions. As a result, we collect initial empirical evidence of performance degradation during cloning (compared to precisely optimal behavior) and performance stability across variations of the environment parameters.

However, designing motion planning techniques and robust control strategies that actively control their deformations are challenging in many applications. Thus, this article presents the learning by Demonstration (LbD) approach for planning the spatial point-to-point motions of a multi-section continuum robot. Via teleoperation, the human demonstrations are captured by moving the flexible interface with similar kinematics of the active robot in front of the Motion Capture System (MCS). Meanwhile, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) scheme is proposed based on the robot’s kinematic model to follow the reference trajectories while respecting the constraints imposed by the cable lengths and control actions. The simulation results prove the efficiency of the LbD approach in reproducing and generalizing the spatial motions of the robot’s tip and avoiding obstacles and external disturbances. On the other hand, the numerical simulations show the performance of NMPC scheme in terms of trajectory tracking and avoiding static and dynamic obstacles. Additionally, its robustness is analyzed by comparing it to the Pseudo-Inverse Jacobian Kinematic Control (PIJKC) while considering the constraints of cable lengths.

10.1109/LRA.2023.3261708,Synergistic Task and Motion Planning With Reinforcement Learning-Based Non-Prehensile Actions,"Robotic manipulation in cluttered environments requires synergistic planning among prehensile and non-prehensile actions. Previous works on sampling-based Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) algorithms, e.g. PDDLStream, provide a fast and generalizable solution for multi-modal manipulation. However, they are likely to fail in cluttered scenarios where no collision-free grasping approaches can be sampled without preliminary manipulations. To extend the ability of sampling-based algorithms, we integrate a vision-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) non-prehensile procedure, pusher. The pushing actions generated by pusher can eliminate interlocked situations and make the grasping problem solvable. Also, the sampling-based algorithm evaluates the pushing actions by providing rewards in the training process, thus the pusher can learn to avoid situations leading to irreversible failures. The proposed hybrid planning method is validated on a cluttered bin-picking problem and implemented in both simulation and real world.

10.1016/j.robot.2023.104386,Mission specification and decomposition for multi-robot systems,"Service robots are increasingly being used to perform missions comprising dangerous or tedious tasks previously executed by humans. However, their users—who know the environment and requirements for these missions—have limited or no robotics experience. As such, they often find the process of allocating concrete tasks to each robot within a multi-robot system (MRS) very challenging. Our paper introduces a framework for Multi-Robot mission Specification and decomposition (MutRoSe) that simplifies and automates key activities of this process. To that end, MutRoSe allows an MRS mission designer to define all relevant aspects of a mission and its environment in a high-level specification language that accounts for the variability of real-world scenarios, the dependencies between task instances, and the reusability of task libraries. Additionally, MutRoSe automates the decomposition of MRS missions defined in this language into task instances, which can then be allocated to specific robots for execution—with all task dependencies appropriately taken into account. We illustrate the application of MutRoSe and show its effectiveness for four missions taken from a recently published repository of MRS applications.",ar,2023-05-01,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,Hierarchical planning | Mission decomposition | Mission specification | Modeling | Multi-robot systems,2-s2.0-85150067700,S0921889023000258,,Article,Gil E.B.,60136210;60024989;60016418,Gran Sasso Science Institute;Universidade de Brasília;University of York,L'Aquila;Brasilia;York,Italy;Brazil;United Kingdom,4,"Gil, Eric Bernd;Rodrigues, Genaína Nunes;Pelliccione, Patrizio;Calinescu, Radu",57219484071;8724027300;8852257900;6507842838,60024989;60024989;60136210;60016418,May 2023,09218890,18079,,Journal,163,,104386,,1,UKRI,EP/V026747/1,UK Research and Innovation,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2023.104386

The new Loss function is defined in such a way that in addition to learning the input data of the network, it creates an adjustable safety margin around the obstacles and ultimately creates a safe path. Moreover, a new global path planning method is also introduced, which is used to create the dataset required to train the proposed neural network. The convergence of this method is mathematically proven and it is shown that this method can also produce a suboptimal path in a much shorter time than the common methods of global path planning reported in the literature. In short, the main purpose of this research consists in providing a method which can create a suboptimal, fast and safe path for a mobile robot from any random starting point to any random destination in a known environment. First, the proposed methods will be implemented for different two-dimensional environments consisting of convex and non-convex obstacles, considering the robot as a point-mass, and then it will be implemented in a simulation environment, AI2THOR.

The proposed method approaches this problem by combining the Fast Marching Square path planning technique with the machine learning method called Gaussian processes (GP). The Fast Marching Square method is used to determine the most unexplored areas of the environment and to plan the path of the vehicle from the current position to the selected point. The GP model is used to obtain predictions about the unexplored regions of the environment based on the collected data so far during the exploration. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for exploration and surveillance has increased exponentially in the recent years, due to their sensor equipment capabilities and their versatility for flying over difficult terrain. By defining the weight each method has on the selection of the next point to explore, we can focus the UAV on the points with more interesting data defined by the user (i.e. bodies of water), the most unexplored regions, or a combination of both. We present an study on the influence of these weights on the mean absolute error (MAE) and predictive variance obtained from the GP model and test the algorithm on a real environment obtained from a satellite image.

Research works on dynamic movement primitives (DMP) has reported promising results, with good imitation effect and convergence to the target. However, DMP still has issues such as learning from multiple demonstrations for different initial conditions and achieving obstacle avoidance considering the distribution and motion of obstacles. One of the effective solutions is combining DMP and model predictive control (MPC). The imitation process was transformed into a receding horizon planning procedure, letting the robot to learn more from nearer demonstrations. It is solved as an optimization problem with obstacles modeled as constraints. However, its drawback includes the heavy computation burden, which can be even aggravated in a multi-obstacle scenario where complicated constraints occur. Thus, in this paper, we propose an enhanced MPDMP+ method that combines the advantages of MPC with potential function for both multi-demonstration imitation and multi-obstacle avoidance effect. A proximal augmented Lagrangian method is proposed to solve the optimization problem. This proposed method has a faster convergence rate and small errors.

With the real-life application of these new technological affordances across disciplines, more universities are engaging students in practical, hands-on interdisciplinary design. This case study aims to train two undergraduates from different disciplines to apply robots and IoT in instructional design to benefit young language learners. The two undergraduates, one majoring in engineering and the other majoring in applied foreign languages, voluntarily participated in this interdisciplinary project-based learning (iPjBL). By creating an emulated environment that connects educational robots and tangible objects, the two designers achieved a theme-based instructional game design. The researchers assessed the quality of their instructional design, compared their design processes, and identified three factors that led to differing designer perspectives—(a) disciplinary training, (b) prior experience, and (c) design beliefs. These different perspectives can be used to help design training for instructional designers from various disciplines on how to apply robots and IoT-based tangible objects in language education. Challenges faced by the two designers included insufficient cross-disciplinary expertise, existing knowledge and skill gaps, and the need to redefine design beliefs to achieve better design outcomes. Issues and needs related to interdisciplinary learning were addressed and synthesized into essential steps to guide future instructional design that incorporates robots and IoT-based tangible objects.

10.1007/s11227-022-04998-z,Mobile robot path planning using improved mayfly optimization algorithm and dynamic window approach,"In order to solve the problems of the basic mayfly optimization algorithm (MOA) in the field of robot path planning, such as slow convergence speed, poor accuracy, insufficient stability, and only applicable to static environment, a fusion algorithm combining improved mayfly optimization algorithm and dynamic window approach is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an improved mayfly optimization algorithm based on Q-learning (IMOA-QL) is proposed to solve robot global path planning problem. Q-learning is taken as the core of the improved mayfly optimization algorithm. For the basic MOA, the inertia weight and positive attraction coefficients are set to fixed values, which are not reasonable and will make the global search ability unbalanced, fall into local optimization easily, and also limit the iteration speed. In this paper, the parameters are adaptively adjusted based on Q-learning, and the appropriate parameters are selected according to the fitness of each mayfly. Meanwhile, the memory mechanism is introduced to speed up the convergence speed and implement the global path planning. Then, the global path nodes are extracted as the sub-target points, and the improved dynamic window approach is used to carry out the local path planning, which effectively improves the dynamic real-time avoidance ability. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed IMOA-QL algorithm in this paper, 20 random simulation experiments are carried out in the 100 × 100 static map environment and compared with the basic mayfly optimization algorithm (MOA) and the mayfly optimization algorithm based on linear adaptive inertia weight (MOA-LAIW). The results show that the average path length of the proposed IMOA-QL algorithm is reduced by 4.48% and 2.17% compared with MOA and MOA-LAIW in simple environment, and the average path length of the proposed IMOA-QL algorithm is reduced by 6.58% and 3.24% compared with MOA and MOA-LAIW in complex environment. In 20 experiments, the average variance of the proposed IMOA-QL algorithm in this paper is reduced by 74.15% and 57.67% compared with MOA and MOA-LAIW in simple environment, and the average variance of the proposed IMOA-QL algorithm is reduced by 51.22% and 38.67% in complex environment compared with MOA and MOA-LAIW. The simulation results show that the proposed IMOA-QL algorithm has significantly improved the accuracy and speed of solution. Moreover, dynamic obstacles are added in the static environment to carry out the simulation test of the fusion dynamic path planning algorithm.

10.1109/TPAMI.2022.3215769,Continuous-Time Fitted Value Iteration for Robust Policies,"Solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is important in many domains including control, robotics and economics. Especially for continuous control, solving this differential equation and its extension the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation, is important as it yields the optimal policy that achieves the maximum reward on a give task. In the case of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation, which includes an adversary controlling the environment and minimizing the reward, the obtained policy is also robust to perturbations of the dynamics. In this paper we propose continuous fitted value iteration (cFVI) and robust fitted value iteration (rFVI). These algorithms leverage the non-linear control-affine dynamics and separable state and action reward of many continuous control problems to derive the optimal policy and optimal adversary in closed form. This analytic expression simplifies the differential equations and enables us to solve for the optimal value function using value iteration for continuous actions and states as well as the adversarial case. Notably, the resulting algorithms do not require discretization of states or actions. We apply the resulting algorithms to the Furuta pendulum and cartpole. We show that both algorithms obtain the optimal policy. The robustness Sim2Real experiments on the physical systems show that the policies successfully achieve the task in the real-world. When changing the masses of the pendulum, we observe that robust value iteration is more robust compared to deep reinforcement learning algorithm and the non-robust version of the algorithm.

However, most of the researches conducted so far focused on centralized algorithms or fully observable environments. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation algorithm for partially observable worlds that extends Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP) to a multi-agent world using a self-absorbed view. This extension is performed in two different ways: Using a POMCP tree with single actions but encoding the other agents’ actions implicitly in the tree edges, which we call SPOMCP. The second view, called GPOMCP, is to apply a POMCP tree with action profiles besides doing a coordinate-wise optimization to find the best single action. Experimental results show that SPOMCP and GPOMCP do fairly well compared to other algorithms. SPOMCP consumes more time than GPOMCP for each iteration since it needs to take time to infer other robots’ actions. GPOMCP does not do such an inference step because its search tree is built by action profiles. Comparison with a centralized POMCP (CPOMCP) indicates that while both SPOMCP and GPOMCP are fully decentralized, they can reach the performance of CPOMCP. However, SPOMCP and GPOMCP consume much less time than CPOMCP.",ar,2023-05-01,Applied Intelligence,Monte-Carlo planning | Multi-robot systems | Partially observable world | Task allocation | Teamwork,2-s2.0-85139095214,,,Article,Amini S.,60028174;60012835,Isfahan University of Technology;Daneshgahe Elm va Sanat e Iran,Isfahan;Tehran,Iran;Iran,3,"Amini, Sara;Palhang, Maziar;Mozayani, Nasser",57913002800;23010138600;23980989100,60028174;60028174;60012835,May 2023,0924669X,23674,15737497,Journal,53,10,,12613-12631,0,IUT,undefined,Isfahan University of Technology,1,2023,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10489-022-04142-7

However, the main drawback is that the approach has to construct the fingerprint map manually during the off-line stage, which is tedious and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel data collection strategy for path planning based on reinforcement learning, namely Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C). Given the limited exploration step length, it needs to maximize the informative CSI data for reducing manual cost. We collect a small amount of real data in advance to predict the rewards of all sampling points by multivariate Gaussian process and mutual information. Then the optimization problem is transformed into a sequential decision process, which can exploit the informative path by A3C. We complete the proposed algorithm in two real-world dynamic environments and extensive experiments verify its performance.

A global stage approach utilizing the RGB-D camera, which combines fast 2-D object recognition and 3-D reconstruction models, is proposed to quickly identify the coarse trajectory. The processes of fast 2-D object recognition and 3-D reconstruction are carried out using a deep neural network model and stereo vision sensor module. This technique can be a better replacement for offline programming or hand gesture controls also known as the teaching trajectory, particularly for the welding robot application. The local positioning stage is then applied using the laser vision module to obtain more precise information of the local environment, guided by the coarse trajectory that was realized in the prior stage (global stage). The efficacy of the proposed system is analyzed by conducting numerous tests using an experimental setup. The experimental finding demonstrates that the suggested study has great potential to automate the welding robot in the manufacturing sector.",ar,2023-04-15,IEEE Sensors Journal,3-D reconstruction | intelligent path planning | laser vision sensor | neural network | welding seam extraction,2-s2.0-85149888597,,,Article,Tran C.C.,60027709,National Taiwan University of Science and Technology,Taipei,Taiwan,2,"Tran, Chi Cuong;Lin, Chyi Yeu",57837017800;50361492700,60027709;60027709,15 April 2023,1530437X,15047,15581748,Journal,23,8,,8591-8604,0,MOE,110-2221-E-011-120,Ministry of Education,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2023.3252637
10.3390/educsci13040379,The Influence of Absorption and Need for Cognition on Students’ Learning Outcomes in Educational Robot-Supported Projects,"The field of educational technology has made significant strides, offering cost-effective multimedia tools and physical resources to facilitate both formal and informal teaching methods in computer science, with a particular emphasis on the development of computational thinking (CT) and programming skills. However, there is a lack of research focusing on practice-based tasks, such as Internet of Things (IoT) projects, for undergraduate students to demonstrate and program educational robots using digital and physical-supported instructional approaches. Specifically, there have been no studies examining the association between students’ learning outcomes and their absorption and need for cognition on different platforms, such as Scratch and LEGO® WeDo. This study aims to provide empirical evidence by comparing the impact of two different platforms commonly used in programming courses to teach undergraduate students how to design, develop, and program IoT projects using educational robots. A quasi-experimental study was carried out to examine whether there were any significant variations in students’ CT skills and programming development, as well as to evaluate their learning outcomes with regard to their need for cognition and absorption when they applied their coding expertise to real-world IoT projects. As a point of reference (control condition), twenty students (n = 20) utilized LEGO® WeDo robotics kits and Scratch for coding tasks, which is the most familiar instructional approach. In the intervention approach (experimental condition), thirty-seven students (n = 37) used LEGO® WeDo robotics kits and their software to learn how to code their educational robots. Participants from the latter group learned how to design and demonstrate the program and showed superior CT skills and programming skills development than their counterparts in the control group who used Scratch. Furthermore, the results indicate that students with higher levels of CT skills and programming execution reveal lower absorption but a higher need for cognition in educational robot-supported IoT projects.",ar,2023-04-01,Education Sciences,absorption | cognition | computational thinking | educational robotics | programming,2-s2.0-85153762662,,,Article,Pellas N.,60006517;60001086,University of Western Macedonia;University of Macedonia,Kozani;Thessaloniki,Greece;Greece,2,"Pellas, Nikolaos;Tzafilkou, Katerina",55930215100;56595176200,60006517;60001086,April 2023,,21100897500,22277102,Journal,13,4,379,,1,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci13040379
10.3390/s23084071,Ball Detection Using Deep Learning Implemented on an Educational Robot Based on Raspberry Pi,"RoboCupJunior is a project-oriented competition for primary and secondary school students that promotes robotics, computer science and programing. Through real life scenarios, students are encouraged to engage in robotics in order to help people. One of the popular categories is Rescue Line, in which an autonomous robot has to find and rescue victims. The victim is in the shape of a silver ball that reflects light and is electrically conductive. The robot should find the victim and place it in the evacuation zone. Teams mostly detect victims (balls) using random walk or distant sensors. In this preliminary study, we explored the possibility of using a camera, Hough transform (HT) and deep learning methods for finding and locating balls with the educational mobile robot Fischertechnik with Raspberry Pi (RPi). We trained, tested and validated the performance of different algorithms (convolutional neural networks for object detection and U-NET architecture for sematic segmentation) on a handmade dataset made of images of balls in different light conditions and surroundings. RESNET50 was the most accurate, and MOBILENET_V3_LARGE_320 was the fastest object detection method, while EFFICIENTNET-B0 proved to be the most accurate, and MOBILENET_V2 was the fastest semantic segmentation method on the RPi. HT was by far the fastest method, but produced significantly worse results. These methods were then implemented on a robot and tested in a simplified environment (one silver ball with white surroundings and different light conditions) where HT had the best ratio of speed and accuracy (4.71 s, DICE 0.7989, IoU 0.6651). The results show that microcomputers without GPUs are still too weak for complicated deep learning algorithms in real-time situations, although these algorithms show much higher accuracy in complicated environment situations.",ar,2023-04-01,Sensors,convolutional neural networks | Hough transform | object detection | Raspberry Pi | RoboCupJunior | semantic segmentation | U-NET architecture,2-s2.0-85153739134,,,Article,Keča D.,60159855,"University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing",Zagreb,Croatia,4,"Keča, Dominik;Kunović, Ivan;Matić, Jakov;Sovic Krzic, Ana",57220987451;57417387600;58199595400;57821993400,60159855;60159855;60159855;60159855,April 2023,14248220,130124,,Journal,23,8,4071,,1,HRZZ,DOK-2020-01-7166,Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/s23084071

10.3390/s23073521,SLP-Improved DDPG Path-Planning Algorithm for Mobile Robot in Large-Scale Dynamic Environment,"Navigating robots through large-scale environments while avoiding dynamic obstacles is a crucial challenge in robotics. This study proposes an improved deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) path planning algorithm incorporating sequential linear path planning (SLP) to address this challenge. This research aims to enhance the stability and efficiency of traditional DDPG algorithms by utilizing the strengths of SLP and achieving a better balance between stability and real-time performance. Our algorithm generates a series of sub-goals using SLP, based on a quick calculation of the robot’s driving path, and then uses DDPG to follow these sub-goals for path planning. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SLP-enhanced DDPG path planning algorithm outperforms traditional DDPG algorithms by effectively navigating the robot through large-scale dynamic environments while avoiding obstacles. Specifically, the proposed algorithm improves the success rate by 12.33% compared to the traditional DDPG algorithm and 29.67% compared to the A*+DDPG algorithm in navigating the robot to the goal while avoiding obstacles.",ar,2023-04-01,Sensors,deep neural network | deep reinforcement learning | mobile robot | path planning,2-s2.0-85152321123,,37050580,Article,Chen Y.,60029306,Wuhan University,Wuhan,China,2,"Chen, Yinliang;Liang, Liang",58181055700;36878878900,60029306;60029306,April 2023,14248220,130124,,Journal,23,7,3521,,1,NSFC,52075392,National Natural Science Foundation of China,1,2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/s23073521
10.1007/s10846-023-01822-5,An Efficiently Convergent Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Trajectory Planning Method for Manipulators in Dynamic Environments,"Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based trajectory planning methods have been designed for manipulator trajectory planning, given their potential in solving the problem of multidimensional spatial trajectory planning. However, many DRL models that have been proposed for manipulators working in dynamic environments face difficulties in obtaining the optimal strategy, thereby preventing them from reaching convergence because of massive ineffective exploration and sparse rewards. In this paper, we solve the inefficient convergence problem at the two levels of the action selection strategy and reward functions. First, this paper designs a dynamic action selection strategy that has a high probability of providing positive samples in the pre-training period by using a variable guide item and effectively reduces invalid exploration. Second, this study proposes a combinatorial reward function that combines the artificial potential field method with a time-energy function, thereby greatly improving the efficiency and stability of DRL-based methods for manipulators trajectory planning in dynamic working environments. Extensive experiments are conducted using the CoppeliaSim simulation model with a freely moving obstacle and the 6-DOF manipulator. The results show that the proposed dynamic action selection strategy and combinatorial reward function can improve the convergence rate on the DDPG, TD3, and SAC DRL algorithms by up to 3-5 times. Furthermore, the mean value of the reward function increases by up to 1.47-2.70 times, and the standard deviation decreases by 27.56% to 56.60%.",ar,2023-04-01,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,Autonomous navigation | Combinatorial reward function | Deep reinforcement learning | Dynamic action selection strategy | Manipulator trajectory planning | Real-time obstacle avoidance,2-s2.0-85151318998,,,Article,Zheng L.,60133762;122233366;108439162,CAS Key Laboratory of Mechanical Behavior and Design of Materials;State Grid of China Technology College;State Grid Anhui Electric Power Research Institute,Hefei;Jinan;Hefei,China;China;China,6,"Zheng, Li;Wang, Ya Hao;Yang, Run;Wu, Shaolei;Guo, Rui;Dong, Erbao",58166295900;57220044952;57220031100;57324391900;56540578900;16443984400,60133762;60133762;60133762;108439162;122233366;60133762,April 2023,09210296,24360,15730409,Journal,107,4,50,,0,NKRDPC,2018YFB1307400,National Key Research and Development Program of China,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10846-023-01822-5

After these conditions are met, this mobile robot is given a specific task, but how the robot will navigate for this task is an important issue. Especially for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), whose application has increased recently, path planning in a three-dimensional (3D) environment is a common problem. This study performs three experimental applications to discover the most suitable path for UAV in 3D environments with large and many obstacles. Inspired by Rapidly Random-Exploring Tree Star (RRT*), the first implementation develops the Goal Distance-based RRT* (GDRRT*) approach, which performs intelligent sampling taking into account the goal distance. In the second implementation, the path discovered by GDRRT* is shortened using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) (PSO-GDRRT*). In the final application, a network with a Bidirectional Long/Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) layer is designed for fast estimation of optimal paths found by PSO-GDRRT* (BiLSTM-PSO-GDRRT*). As a result of these applications, this study provides important novelties: GDRRT* converges to the goal faster than RRT* in large and obstacle-containing 3D environments. To generate groundtruth paths for training the learning-based network, PSO-GDRRT* finds the shortest paths relatively quickly. Finally, BiLSTM-PSO-GDRRT* provides extremely fast path planning for real-time UAV applications.

We are motivated by the future of autonomy that involves multiple robots coordinating in dynamic, unstructured, and adversarial environments to complete complex tasks such as target tracking, environmental mapping, and area monitoring. Such tasks are often modeled as submodular maximization coordination problems. We introduce the first submodular coordination algorithm with bounded tracking regret, i.e., with bounded suboptimality with respect to optimal time-varying actions that know the future a priori. The bound gracefully degrades with the environments' capacity to change adversarially. It also quantifies how often the robots must re-select actions to 'learn' to coordinate as if they knew the future a priori. The algorithm requires the robots to select actions sequentially based on the actions selected by the previous robots in the sequence. Particularly, the algorithm generalizes the seminal Sequential Greedy algorithm by Fisher et al. to unpredictable environments, leveraging submodularity and algorithms for the problem of tracking the best expert.

10.4218/etrij.2021-0446,PartitionTuner: An operator scheduler for deep-learning compilers supporting multiple heterogeneous processing units,"Recently, embedded systems, such as mobile platforms, have multiple processing units that can operate in parallel, such as centralized processing units (CPUs) and neural processing units (NPUs). We can use deep-learning compilers to generate machine code optimized for these embedded systems from a deep neural network (DNN). However, the deep-learning compilers proposed so far generate codes that sequentially execute DNN operators on a single processing unit or parallel codes for graphic processing units (GPUs). In this study, we propose PartitionTuner, an operator scheduler for deep-learning compilers that supports multiple heterogeneous PUs including CPUs and NPUs. PartitionTuner can generate an operator-scheduling plan that uses all available PUs simultaneously to minimize overall DNN inference time. Operator scheduling is based on the analysis of DNN architecture and the performance profiles of individual and group operators measured on heterogeneous processing units. By the experiments for seven DNNs, PartitionTuner generates scheduling plans that perform 5.03% better than a static type-based operator-scheduling technique for SqueezeNet. In addition, PartitionTuner outperforms recent profiling-based operator-scheduling techniques for ResNet50, ResNet18, and SqueezeNet by 7.18%, 5.36%, and 2.73%, respectively.",ar,2023-04-01,ETRI Journal,deep neural network | deep-learning compiler | parallel processing | partitioning,2-s2.0-85149408208,,,Article,Yu M.,60001558,Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute,Daejeon,South Korea,6,"Yu, Misun;Kwon, Yongin;Lee, Jemin;Park, Jeman;Park, Junmo;Kim, Taeho",16679932600;57462293200;55814646700;55515722400;57209628878;57205115208,60001558;60001558;60001558;60001558;60001558;60001558,April 2023,12256463,24783,22337326,Journal,45,2,,318-328,1,MSIP,2018‐0‐00769,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning",0,2023,https://doi.org/10.4218/etrij.2021-0446
10.1109/LRA.2023.3248900,Parallelized Control-Aware Motion Planning With Learned Controller Proxies,"Kinodynamic motion planning enables autonomous robots to find efficient paths while minimizing energy expenditure and avoiding hazards in the environment. However, during plan execution, the controller may deviate from the collision-free path found by the planner due to discrepancies between planning and control, causing inaccurate estimation of path costs and potentially collisions with obstacles. While this can be mitigated by incorporating the vehicle controller into planning, these approaches are generally bottlenecked by the high computation cost of simulating the vehicle dynamics and controller. This letter presents the Parallel Closed-Loop RRT∗ motion planner that uses a fast neural network controller as a substitute for a computationally-demanding controller during planning. Using a neural network controller and parallelizing the planning process makes closed-loop planning tractable for vehicles with nonlinear dynamics and significantly reduces planning time.

10.1016/j.jmsy.2023.01.003,A human-centric framework for robotic task learning and optimization,"One of the main objectives of the fifth industrial revolution is the design and implementation of human-centric production environments. The human is, indeed, placed in the center of the production environment, having a supervision/leading role instead of carrying out heavy/repetitive tasks. To enhance such an industrial paradigm change, industrial operators have to be provided with the tools they need to naturally and easily transfer their knowledge to robotic systems. Such expertise, in fact, is difficult to be coded, especially for non-expert programmers. In addition, due to the reduced specialized manpower, the capability to transfer such knowledge into robotic systems is becoming increasingly critical and demanding. In response to this need, this contribution aims to propose and validate a human-centric approach to transfer the human's knowledge of a task into the robot controller making use of qualitative feedback only (to this end, preference-based optimization is employed). In addition, the modeled human's knowledge is exploited by an optimization algorithm (i.e., nonlinear programming) to maximize the task performance while managing the task constraints. The proposed approach has been implemented and validated for a robotic sealant material deposition task. On the basis of the qualitative feedback provided by the operator, the knowledge related to the deposition task has been transferred to the robotic system and optimized to deal with the hardware and task constraints.

10.1007/s00521-022-07930-x,Cleaning of object surfaces based on deep learning: a method for generating manipulator trajectories using RGB-D semantic segmentation,"A mobile robot with a robotic arm needs to be able to autonomously perceive the operating environment and plan the trajectory of the object’s surface in order to perform surface cleaning tasks in a complex, unstructured environment. This study suggests an autonomous trajectory planning technique for cleaning an object’s surface based on RGB-D semantic segmentation, which enables the robotic arm to move the cleaning mechanism on the object’s surface smoothly and steadily and finish the cleaning process. More particularly, it contains the following: (1) A Double Attention Fusion Net (DAFNet) RGB-D semantic segmentation network is proposed, which successfully integrates color texture features and spatial structure features and enhances the semantic segmentation performance of indoor objects. This network is based on the dual attention mechanism (channel attention and spatial attention). (2) The trajectory planning algorithm for the robot arm is created, and the semantically segmented data is clustered using DBCSCAN. In order to achieve autonomous planning of the cleaning trajectory, the target subject is first extracted, and then the working trajectory of the robot arm is generated via the processes of edge detection, slicing, sampling, fitting, etc. We also compare the accuracy of DAFNet semantic segmentation and other algorithms on SUNRGBD and self-built datasets, experiment with trajectory generation for various objects, and evaluate the online surface cleaning procedure. According to the experimental findings, the DAFNet semantic segmentation model is more accurate than the current models.

10.1016/j.eswa.2022.119423,Humanoid robot path planning using memory-based gravity search algorithm and enhanced differential evolution approach in a complex environment,"The present work focuses on the optimal path planning of humanoid robots in a rugged terrain using a hybrid-based improved gravitational search algorithm (IGSA) tuned with a differentially perturbed velocity (DV) approach. The primary IGSA suffers from the disadvantage of a lower convergence rate and the risk of getting trapped in optimal local conditions. The drawbacks are eliminated by employing a hybrid IGSA-DV path planning approach, which improves the memory and velocity updating scheme. The algorithm is designed to minimize the overall path length of the humanoid, from source to goal, in the minimal time possible. The humanoids, during their locomotion, coordinate with each other to avoid collisions in their journey. The robots make decisions based on the position of the various obstacles within the search space. So, path smoothness is also considered to ensure stability during the locomotion. The work is further focussed on optimizing the energy efficiency of the different joints of the humanoid while walking on even and uneven surfaces. The path planning is performed in real-world and simulation environments, and the results are then compared with the different existing, individual, and hybrid techniques. The comparison of the above approach revealed that the IGSA-DV algorithm showed an optimal outcome in terms of path length and time taken. Moreover, the percentage deviation in the path length and time in both the simulation and experimental environment was within 6%. The Petri-Net approach is implemented along with the proposed technique to avoid confusion among the robots during multiple robot navigations.",ar,2023-04-01,Expert Systems with Applications,Humanoid robot | IGSA-DV | Navigation | Path planning | Webot,2-s2.0-85144090926,S0957417422024423,,Article,Vikas ,60000934,National Institute of Technology Rourkela,Rourkela,India,3,"Vikas, ;Parhi, Dayal Ramakrushna;Kashyap, Abhishek Kumar",57653604900;6603245659;57208783370,60000934;60000934;60000934,1 April 2023,09574174,24201,,Journal,215,,119423,,0,,undefined,,3,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.119423
10.1109/TRO.2022.3210767,Closing the Planning-Learning Loop with Application to Autonomous Driving,"Real-time planning under uncertainty is critical for robots operating in complex dynamic environments. Consider, for example, an autonomous robot vehicle driving in dense, unregulated urban traffic of cars, motorcycles, buses, etc. The robot vehicle has to plan in both short and long terms, in order to interact with many traffic participants of uncertain intentions and drive effectively. Planning explicitly over a long time horizon, however, incurs prohibitive computational cost and is impractical under real-time constraints. To achieve real-time performance for large-scale planning, this work introduces a new algorithm Learning from Tree Search for Driving (LeTS-Drive), which integrates planning and learning in a closed loop, and applies it to autonomous driving in crowded urban traffic in simulation. Specifically, LeTS-Drive learns a policy and its value function from data provided by an online planner, which searches a sparsely sampled belief tree; the online planner in turn uses the learned policy and value functions as heuristics to scale up its run-time performance for real-time robot control. These two steps are repeated to form a closed loop so that the planner and the learner inform each other and improve in synchrony. The algorithm learns on its own in a self-supervised manner, without human effort on explicit data labeling. Experimental results demonstrate that LeTS-Drive outperforms either planning or learning alone, as well as open-loop integration of planning and learning.",ar,2023-04-01,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,Autonomous driving | planning under uncertainty | robot learning,2-s2.0-85143684598,,,Article,Cai P.,60025084;60017161,Shanghai Jiao Tong University;National University of Singapore,Shanghai;Singapore City,China;Singapore,2,"Cai, Panpan;Hsu, David",57007779500;34569904000,60025084;60017161,1 April 2023,15523098,95101,19410468,Journal,39,2,,998-1011,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2022.3210767

The aim of this paper is to propose a new online collision avoidance trajectory planning algorithm for moderate dynamic environments to insure human safety when sharing collaborative tasks. The algorithm contains two parts: trajectory generation and local optimization. Firstly, based on empirical Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DPGMM) distribution learning, a neural network trajectory planner called Collaborative Waypoint Planning network (CWP-net) is proposed to generate all key waypoints required for dynamic obstacle avoidance in joint space according to environmental inputs. These points are used to generate quintic spline smooth motion trajectories with velocity and acceleration constraints. Secondly, we present an improved Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP) algorithm which locally optimizes the generated trajectories of CWP-net by constraining the trajectory optimization range and direction through the DPGMM model.

10.1109/TASE.2022.3183335,Consensus-Based Autonomous Navigation of a Team of RIS-Equipped UAVs for LoS Wireless Communication with Mobile Nodes in High-Density Areas,"The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has gained increased attention for improving the performance and efficiency of the fifth-generation (5G) millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless communication by obviating the propagation and blockage issues. On the other hand, the great flexibility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has made them effective gadgets to enhance the coverage of wireless communication networks. Combining these two emerging technologies, the RIS-outfitted UAV (RISoUAV) is a promising solution for providing line-of-sight (LoS) wireless links for mobile targets (MTs) in obstructed high-dense urban areas. In this light, high-speed real-Time communication is essential for some vital municipal services like ambulances, fire engines, security guards, police, etc. This important goal is achievable thanks to the RISoUAV-Assisted 5G/quasi-optic wireless communication. This paper develops a framework for optimal navigation of a team of RISoUAVs for maintaining LoS links with a team of ground vehicles in a dense urban area. The trajectories of the RISoUAVs are optimized considering the energy efficiency, communication channel gains, and constraints associated with RISoUAVs motion and LoS service. A consensus-based coordinating approach is adopted to coordinate the RISoUAVs navigation to cover all MTs under a good quality of service. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the method. Note to Practitioners-In this paper, we consider a scenario where vehicles need to have high-speed, uninterrupted data links in obstructed, highly dense urban environments. Due to spectrum crunch, the data links are increasingly likely to rely on a high-frequency spectrum, including mmWave with quasi-optic nature, visible light communications, or even laser. However, the obstructed LoS and propagation are critical issues with the 5G and beyond as they rely on the availability of an unobstructed path (e.g., the LoS or a quality reflective path). On the other hand, the RIS performs as a passive reflective element that provides an indirect LoS link, a one-bounce channel, to improve the performance and efficiency of mmWave, and beyond, wireless communication networks. UAVs equipped with RISs are suggested in this paper to be adopted as aerial transponders to reflect signals and facilitate communication in high-density environments. Therefore, the problem of UAV navigation and 3D trajectory planning should be addressed regarding the application, particularly, for providing LoS service for mobile vehicles with arbitrary directions. Autonomous navigation of RISoUAVs for LoS wireless communication is a natural multi-dimensional extension of autonomous navigation with obstacle avoidance where regions in which LoS communication is lost are viewed as obstacles to avoid. However, the environment and valid LoS links can change dynamically due to moving vehicles in the obstructed environment. This makes the navigation design an NP-hard problem that is tackled in this paper by developing an effective navigation program.",ar,2023-04-01,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Autonomous navigation | optimal trajectory | path planning | reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) | unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) | wireless communication,2-s2.0-85133751179,,,Article,Eskandari M.,60082337;60029470,"University of New South Wales, School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications;Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation",Sydney;Canberra,Australia;Australia,3,"Eskandari, Mohsen;Savkin, Andrey V.;Ni, Wei",55955237100;7005027654;35956974500,60082337;60082337;60029470,1 April 2023,15455955,17340,15583783,Journal,20,2,,923-935,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2022.3183335
10.1109/TASE.2022.3182720,Programming-Based Optimal Learning Sliding Mode Control for Cooperative Dual Ship-Mounted Cranes Against Unmatched External Disturbances,"When lifting and transporting large payloads in the marine environment, the dual ship-mounted crane system plays a very important role for cargos transportation, which exhibits strong load capacity and high flexibility. However, apart from the nonlinearity and underactuation characteristic, some unknown or uncertain unmatched wave disturbances may also cause positioning errors, which may induce various risks during the transportation process; besides, lots of existing methods ignore a part of the cooperative crane motions, and the control issue of dual ship-mounted crane system with five degrees of freedoms (5 DOF) is still open. In terms of the aforementioned problems, an adaptive dynamic programming (ADP)-based optimal learning sliding mode controller is proposed in this paper. Specifically, under the frame of adaptive dynamic programming, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation can be addressed. Then, based on the gradient attenuation algorithm, critic neural networks (NNs) are trained depending on the designed updating law and the approximate optimal learning controller can be obtained. Lyapunov techniques and Lasalle's invariance principle are used to guarantee asymptotic stability of the dual ship-mounted cranes system. Finally, a series of simulation results are depicted to show the effectiveness of the proposed optimal learning sliding mode controller. Note to Practitioners-In this paper, the control problem of a 5 DOF dual ship-mounted cranes system with unmatched wave disturbance is studied. Due to the complex nonlinear characteristics of the dual ship-mounted cranes and the need to consider the cooperative lifting and wave disturbances, the operation of the dual ship-mounted cranes are very challenging. Moreover, it brings more difficulties to the design of this kind of controller due to its nonlinear underactuated property. Existing control methods for dual ship-mounted cranes are based on linearized or oversimplified crane models, or require accurate model. To solve these kinds of problems, this paper proposes a new control approach for dual ship-mounted cranes suffering from unmatched wave disturbances to achieve satisfactory performance. The stability analysis of the closed-loop systems equilibrium point is implemented by Lyapunov techniques, implying that the accurate positioning and fast payload swings suppression against unmatched wave disturbances are achieved concurrently. In the future studies, we will apply the proposed control method to industrial dual ship-mounted cranes systems to improve their working safety and efficiency.",ar,2023-04-01,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,adaptive dynamic programming | critic neural network | Dual ship-mounted cranes system | nonlinear system | optimal learning sliding mode control,2-s2.0-85132723052,,,Article,Qian Y.,60032389;60018038,Hebei University of Technology;Nankai University,Tianjin;Tianjin,China;China,4,"Qian, Yuzhe;Hu, Die;Chen, Yuzhu;Fang, Yongchun",56308301900;57223041042;57223050212;57218659745,60032389;60032389;60032389;60018038,1 April 2023,15455955,17340,15583783,Journal,20,2,,969-980,0,,undefined,,4,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2022.3182720

However, most current sampling-based path planning algorithms are easy to fall into the trap space in complex and dynamic environments. In this article, a fast path planning algorithm based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is proposed to allow robotic systems to efficiently extract feature nodes and generate collision-free paths considering the pedestrian density and the environmental structure. First, the preliminary feature nodes are obtained by training GMM, in which the covariance matrix of each feature node contains the environmental structure information. Second, an online feature learning method is presented to extract features during the movement of the robot by the dual-channel scale filter and the secondary distance fusion. Once the obstacle-free grid points can be connected to the feature nodes without any collision, a heuristic path is generated directly to guide the robot to avoid the crowds according to the proposed pedestrian matrix. For the same environment, the learned information can be reused as prior knowledge in the next path planning to further improve the efficiency of path replanning.

10.1109/TASE.2022.3174141,Socially Aware Robot Navigation Framework: Where and How to Approach People in Dynamic Social Environments,"This paper proposes a human approaching robot navigation framework that enables a mobile service robot to (i) estimate a socially optimal approaching pose, and (ii) navigate safely and socially to the estimated approaching pose. In the first stage, the robot estimates potential approaching poses of a human or a human group, which the robot can safely and socially approach, using the dynamic social zone model. In the second stage, the proposed framework selects a socially optimal approaching pose, then estimate a socially optimal trajectory of the robot using the proposed goal-oriented timed elastic band (GTEB) model. The developed GTEB model takes into account the current robot's states, robot dynamics, dynamic social zone, regular obstacles and potential approaching poses to generate the socially optimal robot trajectory from the robot's current pose to the selected optimal approaching pose. The motion control command extracted from the socially optimal trajectory is then utilized to drive the mobile robot to approach the individual humans or human groups, while safely and socially avoiding regular obstacles, human and human groups during the navigation process. The proposed approaching human framework is verified in the both simulation and real robots. The results illustrate that, the mobile robot equipped with our developed GTEB model is able to safely and socially approach and avoid individual humans and human groups, while guaranteeing the comfortable safety for the humans and socially acceptable behaviors for the robot. Note to Practitioners - Although our proposed GTEB model is capable of estimating a socially optimal approaching pose and social robot trajectory, driving the robot to approach a human and a human group, and providing the safety and comfort for humans and socially acceptable behaviors of the robot, there exists a few drawbacks if we wish to apply the proposed approaching human framework in dynamic social environments. First, the optimizer for the GTEB model should be improved in terms of computational time and accuracy to avoid generating unpredictable robot trajectories, especially in dynamic social environments. Second, the socio-spatio-temporal characteristics of the humans including human position, motion and orientation, and human group and human-object interactions play an important role in the proposed GTEB model. However, the existing techniques are only suitable in quasi-dynamic social environments. Hence, highly accurate, robust and real-time algorithms for human detection and tracking, and social interaction detection are necessary. Third, social interactive intentions such as human-robot, human-human and human-object interactive intentions should be predicted and incorporated into the proposed framework to improve the performance of the developed framework in the dynamic social environments. Last but not least, human and human group identification algorithms should be proposed to enable the robot to identify the humans, whose the mobile robot is requested to approach. In the future, the social interactive intentions, the human's future states and its trajectories and will be predicted using deep learning algorithms and incorporated into the approaching human framework to improve the performance of the proposed framework.",ar,2023-04-01,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,human approaching methods | Mobile service robots | social robots | socially aware robot navigation | timed elastic band,2-s2.0-85130474755,,,Article,Hoang V.B.,60121871;60007655,Le Quy Don Technical University;University of Prince Edward Island,Hanoi;Charlottetown,Viet Nam;Canada,4,"Hoang, Van Bay;Nguyen, Van Hung;Ngo, Trung Dung;Truong, Xuan Tung",57222040663;7203068818;15755660100;56581881400,60121871;60121871;60007655;60121871,1 April 2023,15455955,17340,15583783,Journal,20,2,,1322-1336,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2022.3174141

The geometric information is extracted from the point cloud of obstacles. By analyzing the properties of the point cloud, we propose a VAE feature extraction net that incorporates the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework with unique architectures designed for point clouds. Furthermore, we design a multi-modal sampling net to model the probability distribution of the states based on training trajectories taken from different environments. Based on PGSN, we propose a sampling-based motion planning algorithm called the point-guided rapidly-exploring random tree (PG-RRT). Three experiments are conducted to verify the proposed PGSN: Exp I shows the proposed VAE feature extraction net can successfully extract geometric features from the inputted point cloud; Exp II verifies the multi-modal sampling net successfully chooses corresponding mode with respect to extracted features; Exp III demonstrates the efficacy of our PG-RRT algorithm by showing PG-RRT outperforms other algorithms. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis and insights towards understanding our model. Note to Practitioners - Obstacles cause lots of the sampling space invalid, thus the traditional sampling-based motion planning (SBMP) algorithm is usually unable to generate a trajectory within a reasonable short period of time. To improve the success rate and efficiency of SBMP, this paper proposes a novel deep neural network called points-guided sampling net (PGSN). PGSN is designed to exploit: (1) environmental point clouds and (2) training trajectories from multiple environments with different obstacles. In the first step, the point clouds include important geometric information. To utilize this information, we adopt a variational autoencoder approach which combines an encoder and a decoder together to extract geometric features more accurately from point clouds. In the second step, trajectories from multiple environments have a multi-modal property which can be represented by a truncated multivariate Gaussian mixture model. We propose a multi-modal sampling net to learn optimal parameters of this model from the training trajectories, and to select corresponding mode based on the extracted features. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is feasible and can achieve higher success rate than the state-of-the-art methods.

10.1108/RIA-09-2022-0226,Long-term robot manipulation task planning with scene graph and semantic knowledge,"Purpose: Autonomous robots must be able to understand long-term manipulation tasks described by humans and perform task analysis and planning based on the current environment in a variety of scenes, such as daily manipulation and industrial assembly. However, both classical task and motion planning algorithms and single data-driven learning planning methods have limitations in practicability, generalization and interpretability. The purpose of this work is to overcome the limitations of the above methods and achieve generalized and explicable long-term robot manipulation task planning. Design/methodology/approach: The authors propose a planning method for long-term manipulation tasks that combines the advantages of existing methods and the prior cognition brought by the knowledge graph. This method integrates visual semantic understanding based on scene graph generation, regression planning based on deep learning and multi-level representation and updating based on a knowledge base. Findings: The authors evaluated the capability of this method in a kitchen cooking task and tabletop arrangement task in simulation and real-world environments. Experimental results show that the proposed method has a significantly improved success rate compared with the baselines and has excellent generalization performance for new tasks. Originality/value: The authors demonstrate that their method is scalable to long-term manipulation tasks with varying complexity and visibility. This advantage allows their method to perform better in new manipulation tasks.

To investigate the opportunities of using a different programming paradigm than the imperative approach to learning embedded coding, we developed Flowboard. Students code in a visual iPad editor using flow-based programming, which is conceptually closer to circuit diagrams than imperative code. Two breadboards with I/O pins mirrored on the iPad connect electronics and program graph more seamlessly than existing IDEs. Program changes take effect immediately. This liveness reflects circuit behavior better than edit-compile-run loops.

10.3901/JME.2023.06.173,Augmented Reality-assisted Mutual Cognitive System for Human-Robot Interaction Safety Concerns,"In modern manufacturing, the interaction and symbiosis between humans and the industrial robot are one of the foci of smart manufacturing. During human-robot interaction(HRI), the potential risk of any injury to workers caused by industrial robots is very critical and should be well-addressed to ensure manufacturing safety. However, in the dynamic and uncertain manufacturing environment, the current HRI safety is still based on the robot's perception of the environment to achieve collision avoidance, lacking adaptable decision-makings under mutual cognition. Therefore, to enhance the cognition of human operators in the working environment and improve the robot's collision avoidance and adaptive motion planning capabilities, this work designs and further implements a mutual cognitive HRI safety system based on augmented reality (AR) in a wearable manner. In the proposed system, the wearable AR device serves as the bridging interface to realize the virtual-real registration of the robot, the virtual-physical mapping of the working environment of the HRI process, and to collect the information of human, robot, and working space. In addition to these, a hierarchical HRI safety strategy is introduced for real-time mutual cognitive assistance to both humans and robots, namely: 1) robot motion speed control and safety area visualization based on human-robot distance, 2) virtual-physical mapping for robot motion preview and collision detection, and 3) deep reinforcement learning-driven motion planning for collision avoidance strategies generation. Lastly, a prototype system is further developed to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategies. By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence and human-robot interaction technologies, it is envisioned this work can bring insightful safety protection mechanisms to better achieve symbiotic human-robot collaboration.",ar,2023-03-01,Jixie Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Mechanical Engineering,augmented reality | human-robot interaction | reinforcement learning | safety strategy | smart manufacturing,2-s2.0-85163747032,,,Article,Zheng P.,60277659;60117837;60010953;60008928;60002014,"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Shenzhen Research Institute;School of Mechanical Engineering, Zhejiang University;Donghua University;The Hong Kong Polytechnic University;The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)",Shenzhen;Hangzhou;Shanghai;Hong Kong;Stockholm,China;China;China;Hong Kong;Sweden,8,"Zheng, Pai;Li, Chengxi;Yin, Yue;Zhang, Rong;Bao, Jinsong;Wang, Baicun;Xie, Haibo;Wang, Lihui",56352424300;57226701156;57700194200;57222149011;58343120800;57201431988;58412710600;55080150600,60008928-60277659;60008928;60008928;60010953;60010953;60117837;60117837;60002014,March 2023,05776686,20948,,Journal,59,6,,173-184,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.3901/JME.2023.06.173

10.1007/s10846-023-01829-y,Planning Multi-fingered Grasps with Reachability Awareness in Unrestricted Workspace,"In the unstructured real-world, general object grasping with multi-fingered robot hands requires robots to plan stable and reachable grasps for a plethora of unknown objects and be efficient in arbitrary workspace. Motivated by these rigorous demands, we propose a reachability-aware multi-fingered grasp planning framework that can synthesize feasible high-DOF grasps for novel objects in unrestricted workspace. The framework includes an end-to-end voxel-based Grasp Prediction Network (GPN) for generating stable multi-fingered grasp configurations and a learned Grasping Reachability Evaluator (GRE) to estimate kinematic reachability. The GPN takes as input a voxel representation of the scene and directly outputs the predicted collision-free multi-fingered grasps and the associated grasping stability. The GRE then evaluates the grasping reachability of each generated grasp configuration. Based on the predicted grasping reachability and stability, the most feasible grasp is ultimately executed by the robot. In contrast to previous methods that plan successful grasps within restricted workspace solely based on grasping stability, our approach further incorporates a concept of reachability into the online multi-fingered grasp planning via neural networks. The real-world experiments show that our approach outperforms several comparable methods and achieves an average completion rate of 82.2% for unseen cluttered objects in unrestricted scenarios.

To mitigate this problem, we propose LocateUAV, a novel location awareness framework, to detect UAV's location by processing the data from the visual sensor in real time using a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN). Assuming that the drone is in an IoT environment, first, the object detection technique is applied to detect the object of interest (OOI), namely, signboard.

In the final step, the extracted information is forwarded to the map application programming interface (API) to locate the UAV. We also present a newly created data set for LocateUAV, which comprises challenging scenarios for context analysis. Moreover, we also compress an existing lightweight model up to 45 MB for efficient processing over UAV, which is 19.5% when compared with the size of the original model.

To explain the RL-based dynamic obstacle avoidance method, this letter focuses on a CDPR with four fixed-length cables connected to four MBs. An RL-based Obstacle Avoidance Controller (OAC) is developed and integrated into a trajectory tracking controller to address the dynamic obstacle avoidance problem of a CDPR with MBs tracking a target trajectory.

However, motion planning and control of flexible manipulators is challenging due to their compliance behavior and system uncertainties. Thus, this letter presents an Imitation-based Motion Planning (IbMP) approach, along with dynamic impedance control for learning, planning, and trajectory tracking of a two-section soft continuum robot in a dynamic environment. Point-to-point motion demonstrations, including the robot's tip position and orientation are intuitively provided by a motion capture system (OptiTrack V120-trio) and a similar kinematic flexible interface. Additionally, a singularity-free dynamic model based on Lagrangian formulation and Taylor expansion series of a two-section continuum robot is derived while planning for robot motions. The simulation results show that the IbMP approach, along with the dynamic impedance control, generalizes the robot's motion by varying the initial and goal of the robot's tip pose while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles, and moving back to the desired track after disturbances. Finally, the stability and performance of the IbMP algorithm against input disturbances are assessed using a Monte Carlo approach that can guide the selection of gain values.",ar,2023-03-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,dynamic movement primitives | impedance control | Monte-Carlo | Soft robot,2-s2.0-85147264759,,,Article,Seleem I.A.,60273876;60023462;60003419,Faculty of Engineering;Waseda University;Faculty of Electronic Engineering,New Borg El Arab;Tokyo;Shibin El Kom,Egypt;Japan;Egypt,3,"Seleem, Ibrahim A.;El-Hussieny, Haitham;Ishii, Hiroyuki",57192209663;20433398600;57777208400,60023462-60003419;60273876;60023462,1 March 2023,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,8,3,,1351-1358,1,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2023.3239306
10.1016/j.tsc.2022.101218,The impact of story-inspired programming on preschool children's computational thinking: A multi-group experiment,"Computational thinking (CT) has received worldwide attention due to its alignment with developing 21st century skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence. With the increasing provision of programming tools such as robotic toys and tablet apps in the sector of early childhood education (ECE), many ECE researchers and practitioners tend to link CT to programming. However, children are reluctant to sustain their interests in programming activities, and may be further demotivated by debugging failures. This multi-group quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a story-inspired approach in bridging the gap between programming and CT for preschool children. Building on previous literature suggesting storytelling as a powerful, culturally responsive pedagogy, 5-year-old children (N=108) were involved in nine weeks of CT learning via one of the three conditions: Story-Inspired Robot Programming (SIRP), Story-Inspired Tablet Programming (SITP), and unplugged CT education.

10.1007/s41315-022-00262-y,An imitation learning approach for the control of a low-cost low-accuracy robotic arm for unstructured environments,"We have developed an imitation learning approach for the image-based control of a low-cost low-accuracy robot arm. The image-based control of manipulation arms is still an unsolved problem, at least under challenging conditions such as those here addressed. Many attempts for solutions in the literature are based on machine learning, generally relying on deep neural network architectures. In typical imitation approaches, the deep network learns from a human expert. In our case the network is trained on state/action pairs obtained through a Belief Space Planning algorithm, a stochastic method that requires only a rough tuning, particularly suited to unstructured and dynamic environments. Our approach allows to obtain a lightweight manipulation system that demonstrated its efficiency, robustness and good performance in real-world tests, and that is reproducible in experiments and results, despite its inaccuracy and non-repeatable kinematics. The proposed system performs well on a simple reaching task, requiring limited training on our quite challenging platform. The main contribution of the proposed work lies in the definition and real-world testing of an efficient controller, based on the integration of Belief Space Planning with the imitation learning paradigm, that enables even inaccurate, very low-cost robotic manipulators to be actually controlled and employed in the field.",ar,2023-03-01,International Journal of Intelligent Robotics and Applications,Belief space planning | Imitation learning | Inaccurate lightweight manipulator | Soft robotics,2-s2.0-85141688126,,,Article,Bonsignorio F.,60021199;60008408;107904698,Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche;University of Zagreb;Heron Robots,Rome;Zagreb;Genoa,Italy;Croatia;Italy,4,"Bonsignorio, Fabio;Cervellera, Cristiano;Macciò, Danilo;Zereik, Enrica",14015159200;6507513909;23571007500;35106497900,107904698-60008408;60021199;60021199;60021199,March 2023,23665971,21100935977,2366598X,Journal,7,1,,13-30,1,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41315-022-00262-y
10.1109/TII.2022.3188359,Reinforcement Learning Heuristic A*,"In a graph search algorithm, a given environment is represented as a graph comprising a set of feasible system configurations and their neighboring connections. A path is generated by connecting the initial and goal configurations through graph exploration, whereby the path is often desired to be optimal or suboptimal. The computational performance of the optimal path generation depends on the avoidance of unnecessary explorations. Accordingly, heuristic functions have been widely adopted to guide the exploration efficiently by providing estimated costs to the goal configurations. The exploration is efficient when the heuristic functions estimate the optimal cost closely, which remains challenging because it requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment. However, this challenge presents the scope to improve the computational efficiency over the existing methods. Herein, we propose reinforcement learning heuristic A∗ (RLHA*), which adopts an artificial neural network as a learning heuristic function to closely estimate the optimal cost, while achieving a bounded suboptimal path. Instead of being trained by precomputed paths, the learning heuristic function keeps improving by using self-generated paths. Numerous simulations were performed to demonstrate the consistent and robust performance of RLHA∗ by comparing it with the existing methods.",ar,2023-03-01,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,Graph search | path planning | reinforcement learning,2-s2.0-85134225033,,,Article,Ha J.,60102538;60025960,Karlsruher Institut für Technologie;Korea Institute of Science and Technology,Karlsruhe;Seoul,Germany;South Korea,3,"Ha, Junhyoung;An, Byungchul;Kim, Soonkyum",56423104900;37048367500;58462205800,60025960;60102538;60025960,1 March 2023,15513203,144912,19410050,Journal,19,3,,2307-2316,0,KMDF,RS-2020-KD000090,Korea Medical Device Development Fund,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2022.3188359

Design/methodology/approach: This case study draws on data collected during an inquiry-oriented instructional unit in which students learn to collect, display and interpret data from their surrounding environment by wiring and programming a physical computing system. Using interaction analysis, the authors analyzed video recordings of one teacher’s (Gabrielle) pedagogical moves as she supported students in debugging their systems as they drew upon a variety of embodied, material and social resources. Findings: This study presents Gabrielle’s debugging interactional grammar, highlighting the pedagogical possibilities for supporting students in systematic ways, providing affective support (e.g. showing them care and encouragement) and positioning herself as a learner with the students. Gabrielle’s practice, and therefore her pedagogy, has the potential to support students in becoming better debuggers on their own in the future. Originality/value: While much of the prior work on learning to debug focuses on learner actions and possible errors, this case focuses on an educator’s debugging pedagogy centered on the educator debugging with the learners. This case study illustrates the need for educators to exhibit deft facilitation, vulnerability and orchestration skills to support student development of their own process for and agency in debugging.",ar,2023-02-28,Information and Learning Science,Computational thinking | Debugging pedagogies | Interaction analysis | Physical computing | Science education | Situated inquiry,2-s2.0-85145733684,,,Article,Hennessy Elliott C.,60031706;60015609;60014662;60000221,Utah State University;San Jose State University;Drexel University;University of Colorado Boulder,Logan;San Jose;Philadelphia;Boulder,United States;United States;United States;United States,5,"Hennessy Elliott, Colin;Gendreau Chakarov, Alexandra;Bush, Jeffrey B.;Nixon, Jessie;Recker, Mimi",57190813463;57208306482;57194013851;57203986913;6603456885,60000221-60014662;60015609;60000221;60031706;60031706,28 February 2023,23985348,21100805777,,Journal,124,1-2,,1-24,0,NSF,1742046,National Science Foundation,3,2023,https://doi.org/10.1108/ILS-03-2022-0051

10.3390/s23041867,Path Planning for Unmanned Delivery Robots Based on EWB-GWO Algorithm,"With the rise of robotics within various fields, there has been a significant development in the use of mobile robots. For mobile robots performing unmanned delivery tasks, autonomous robot navigation based on complex environments is particularly important. In this paper, an improved Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO)-based algorithm is proposed to realize the autonomous path planning of mobile robots in complex scenarios. First, the strategy for generating the initial wolf pack of the GWO algorithm is modified by introducing a two-dimensional Tent–Sine coupled chaotic mapping in this paper. This guarantees that the GWO algorithm generates the initial population diversity while improving the randomness between the two-dimensional state variables of the path nodes. Second, by introducing the opposition-based learning method based on the elite strategy, the adaptive nonlinear inertia weight strategy and random wandering law of the Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA), this paper improves the defects of slow convergence speed, low accuracy, and imbalance between global exploration and local mining functions of the GWO algorithm in dealing with high-dimensional complex problems. In this paper, the improved algorithm is named as an EWB-GWO algorithm, where EWB is the abbreviation of three strategies. Finally, this paper enhances the rationalization of the initial population generation of the EWB-GWO algorithm based on the visual-field line detection technique of Bresenham’s line algorithm, reduces the number of iterations of the EWB-GWO algorithm, and decreases the time complexity of the algorithm in dealing with the path planning problem. The simulation results show that the EWB-GWO algorithm is very competitive among metaheuristics of the same type. It also achieves optimal path length measures and smoothness metrics in the path planning experiments.",ar,2023-02-01,Sensors,adaptive nonlinear inertia weights | BOA algorithm | GWO algorithm | mobile robot | opposition-based learning | path planning | two-dimensional chaotic mapping,2-s2.0-85148976440,,36850464,Article,Luo Y.,60020620,Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Chongqing,China,4,"Luo, Yuan;Qin, Qiong;Hu, Zhangfang;Zhang, Yi",35932400400;57747111400;7404211399;55912101500,60020620;60020620;60020620;60020620,February 2023,14248220,130124,,Journal,23,4,1867,,1,,2022CDPFAT-01,,2,2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/s23041867
10.3390/s23041873,Learning 3D Bipedal Walking with Planned Footsteps and Fourier Series Periodic Gait Planning,"Reinforcement learning provides a general framework for achieving autonomy and diversity in traditional robot motion control. Robots must walk dynamically to adapt to different ground environments in complex environments. To achieve walking ability similar to that of humans, robots must be able to perceive, understand and interact with the surrounding environment. In 3D environments, walking like humans on rugged terrain is a challenging task because it requires complex world model generation, motion planning and control algorithms and their integration. So, the learning of high-dimensional complex motions is still a hot topic in research. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based footstep tracking method, which tracks the robot’s footstep position by adding periodic and symmetrical information of bipedal walking to the reward function. The robot can achieve robot obstacle avoidance and omnidirectional walking, turning, standing and climbing stairs in complex environments. Experimental results show that reinforcement learning can be combined with real-time robot footstep planning, avoiding the learning of path-planning information in the model training process, so as to avoid the model learning unnecessary knowledge and thereby accelerate the training process.",ar,2023-02-01,Sensors,footstep planning | gait phase | humanoid | reinforcement learning,2-s2.0-85148973119,,36850469,Article,Wang S.,60019616,Harbin Institute of Technology,Harbin,China,4,"Wang, Song;Piao, Songhao;Leng, Xiaokun;He, Zhicheng",55206376500;6701581548;56198191700;57202116441,60019616;60019616;60019616;60019616,February 2023,14248220,130124,,Journal,23,4,1873,,1,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/s23041873
10.3390/s23042036,A Mapless Local Path Planning Approach Using Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework,"The key module for autonomous mobile robots is path planning and obstacle avoidance. Global path planning based on known maps has been effectively achieved. Local path planning in unknown dynamic environments is still very challenging due to the lack of detailed environmental information and unpredictability. This paper proposes an end-to-end local path planner n-step dueling double DQN with reward-based (Formula presented.) -greedy (RND3QN) based on a deep reinforcement learning framework, which acquires environmental data from LiDAR as input and uses a neural network to fit Q-values to output the corresponding discrete actions. The bias is reduced using n-step bootstrapping based on deep Q-network (DQN). The (Formula presented.) -greedy exploration-exploitation strategy is improved with the reward value as a measure of exploration, and an auxiliary reward function is introduced to increase the reward distribution of the sparse reward environment. Simulation experiments are conducted on the gazebo to test the algorithm’s effectiveness. The experimental data demonstrate that the average total reward value of RND3QN is higher than that of algorithms such as dueling double DQN (D3QN), and the success rates are increased by 174%, 65%, and 61% over D3QN on three stages, respectively.

Exploration efficiency and prediction accuracy largely depend on appropriate waypoint decision. In this paper, an informative path planning approach is proposed based on the reinforcement learning paradigm for static environment exploration. In contrast to model based algorithms, no assumption is presumed for the environmental features. The computational cost is reduced and the online planning capability is enhanced by evaluating the values of actions through robot’s interaction with the environment. To improve the prediction accuracy, an action selection algorithm based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) is utilized to balance exploration and utilization.

One of the promising approaches to solve it is decomposing the problem into the smaller sub-problems and combining the local solutions into the global one. The crux of any planning method for non-holonomic robots is the generation of motion primitives that generates solutions to local planning sub-problems. In this work we introduce a novel learnable steering function (policy), which takes into account kinodynamic constraints of the robot and both static and dynamic obstacles. This policy is efficiently trained via the policy optimization. Empirically, we show that our steering function generalizes well to unseen problems. We then plug in the trained policy into the sampling-based and lattice-based planners, and evaluate the resultant POLAMP algorithm (Policy Optimization that Learns Adaptive Motion Primitives) in a range of challenging setups that involve a car-like robot operating in the obstacle-rich parking-lot environments. We show that POLAMP is able to plan collision-free kinodynamic trajectories with success rates higher than 92%, when 50 simultaneously moving obstacles populate the environment showing better performance than the state-of-the-art competitors.",ar,2023-02-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Motion and path planning | reinforcement learning | task and motion planning,2-s2.0-85147191855,,,Article,Angulo B.,60021331;126888981;126532924,Russian Academy of Sciences;AIRI;Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (State University),Moscow;Moscow;Moscow region,Russian Federation;Russian Federation;Russian Federation,3,"Angulo, Brian;Panov, Aleksandr;Yakovlev, Konstantin",57224485197;56504794900;57125950700,126532924;60021331-126888981;60021331-126888981,1 February 2023,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,8,2,,824-831,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3233261
10.1109/LRA.2022.3231520,Planning Visual-Tactile Precision Grasps via Complementary Use of Vision and Touch,"Reliably planning fingertip grasps for multi-fingered hands lies as a key challenge for many tasks including tool use, insertion, and dexterous in-hand manipulation. This task becomes even more difficult when the robot lacks an accurate model of the object to be grasped. Tactile sensing offers a promising approach to account for uncertainties in object shape. However, current robotic hands tend to lack full tactile coverage. As such, a problem arises of how to plan and execute grasps for multi-fingered hands such that contact is made with the area covered by the tactile sensors. To address this issue, we propose an approach to grasp planning that explicitly reasons about where the fingertips should contact the estimated object surface while maximizing the probability of grasp success. Key to our method's success is the use of visual surface estimation for initial planning to encode the contact constraint. The robot then executes this plan using a tactile-feedback controller that enables the robot to adapt to online estimates of the object's surface to correct for errors in the initial plan. Importantly, the robot never explicitly integrates object pose or surface estimates between visual and tactile sensing, instead it uses the two modalities in complementary ways. Vision guides the robots motion prior to contact; touch updates the plan when contact occurs differently than predicted from vision. We show that our method successfully synthesises and executes precision grasps for previously unseen objects using surface estimates from a single camera view. Further, our approach outperforms a state of the art multi-fingered grasp planner, while also beating several baselines we propose.",ar,2023-02-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Deep learning in grasping and manipulation | grasping | multifingered hands,2-s2.0-85146235487,,,Article,Matak M.,60076695;60025488,NVIDIA;The University of Utah,Santa Clara;Salt Lake City,United States;United States,2,"Matak, Martin;Hermans, Tucker",57219438413;36730868000,60025488;60025488-60076695,1 February 2023,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,8,2,,768-775,0,NSF,1846341,National Science Foundation,2,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3231520
10.1016/j.compag.2022.107593,Coverage path planning for kiwifruit picking robots based on deep reinforcement learning,"In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning-based path planning method for kiwifruit picking robot coverage is proposed. Compared with existing approaches, the novelty of this paper is twofold. 1. Using a LiDAR to collect the environmental point cloud information of the kiwifruit orchard and construct a two-dimensional grid map. In the process of constructing the map, the fruit coordinate information is collected in real time, and the fruit coordinates are projected onto the grid map to obtain the distribution of kiwifruit in the orchard environment. Combined with the effective picking area of a kiwifruit picking robot, a kiwifruit area division algorithm is proposed, which converts the traditional grid-based coverage path planning into a travelling salesman (TSP) problem of solving the traversal order of each area. 2. An improved deep reinforcement learning algorithm, the re-DQN algorithm, is proposed to solve the traversal order of each region. The model training results show that the algorithm is more effective than the traditional DQN algorithm, completing model convergence to a better solution. The experimental results of kiwifruit orchard navigation show that the coverage path length of the method proposed in this paper is 220.67 m, which is 31.56 % shorter than that of the boustrophedon algorithm. The overall navigation time is 1200 s, which is 35.72 % shorter than that of the boustrophedon algorithm.

10.1109/LRA.2022.3227860,Neural Joint Space Implicit Signed Distance Functions for Reactive Robot Manipulator Control,"In this letter, we present an approach for learning a neural implicit signed distance function expressed in joint space coordinates, that efficiently computes distance-to-collisions for arbitrary robotic manipulator configurations. Computing such distances is a long standing problem in robotics as approximate representations of the robot and environment geometry can lead to overly conservative constraints, numerical instabilities and expensive computations - limiting real-time reactive control and task success. Leveraging GPU parallelization and the differentiable nature of the proposed distance function allows for fast calculation of gradients with respect to the neural network inputs, providing a continuous repulsive vector field directly in joint space. We show that the learned high-resolution collision representation can be used to achieve real-time reactive control by i) formulating it as a collision-avoidance constraint for a quadratic programming (QP) inverse kinematics (IK), and ii) introducing it as a collision cost in a sampling-based joint space model predictive controller (MPC). For a reaching benchmark task with a 7DoF robot and dynamic obstacles intentionally obstructing the robot's path we achieve average 250 Hz control frequency with QP-IK and 92 Hz with MPC, showing an accelerated performance of 15% for QP-IK and 40% for MPC over baseline distance computation techniques.",ar,2023-02-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Collision Avoidance | Model Learning for Control | Reactive and Sensor-Based Planning,2-s2.0-85144806711,,,Article,Koptev M.,60028186;60006297,Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;University of Pennsylvania,Lausanne;Philadelphia,Switzerland;United States,3,"Koptev, Mikhail;Figueroa, Nadia;Billard, Aude",57198356561;55626617600;7006389948,60028186;60006297;60028186,1 February 2023,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,8,2,,480-487,1,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2022.3227860
10.1016/j.robot.2022.104322,A BPMN-driven framework for Multi-Robot System development,"Programming robotic systems is often a challenging task requiring advanced skills, especially when the goal is to ensure loosely-coupled coordination in heterogeneous Multi-Robot Systems (MRSs). Model-driven approaches for robotic system engineering have shown their benefits in facilitating the development of robots’ behavior, controllers, and system components. However, the state of the art still lacks contributions addressing crucial aspects of the model-driven approach applied to MRSs, such as developing robots’ distributed cooperation through models supporting the communication among robots. In this paper, we present a novel framework for modeling, configuring and enacting the cooperative behaviors of MRSs through collaboration diagrams as provided by the BPMN 2.0 standard. The advantages of our solution lie, indeed, in the use of BPMN, which provides easily understandable and highly expressive diagrams for representing the cooperation among distributed robots, and benefits from a wide list of supporting tools. Starting from the selection of BPMNelements, we define a set of guidelines for driving the developer in modeling an MRS mission using BPMN. The developer configures the resulting collaboration diagram to link elements in the model to the robotic middleware, ROS2 in the toolchain we implemented. Finally, the configured model is enacted by BPMN engines integrated into the ROS2 middleware run by each robot involved in the MRS, thus obtaining a fully distributed cooperation. We assess our framework's effectiveness through experiments in simulated and real environments.",ar,2023-02-01,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,BPMN | Enactment framework | Model-driven development | Multi-robot systems,2-s2.0-85143852195,S0921889022002111,,Article,Corradini F.,60026298;60021859,Università degli Studi di Camerino;Università degli Studi di Firenze,Camerimo;Florence,Italy;Italy,5,"Corradini, Flavio;Pettinari, Sara;Re, Barbara;Rossi, Lorenzo;Tiezzi, Francesco",55679592700;57385715900;23390178600;57196052573;23089657900,60026298;60026298;60026298;60026298;60021859,February 2023,09218890,18079,,Journal,160,,104322,,0,,undefined,,1,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2022.104322

It plays an essential role in the machinery manufacturing industry. At the moment, in most industries, welding robots still work by teaching and payback. When the welding object or conditions change, the robot cannot make corresponding adjustments in time, which makes the welding gun deviate from the weld center, resulting in the decline of welding quality. The realization of automatic and intelligent welding is the inevitable development trend in the future. The application of machine vision in the welding field will promote the transformation of welding technology from rigid welding automation to flexible welding intelligence. Welding automation and intelligence are intended to improve the working conditions and environment, reduce labor costs, and improve product quality. Robotic welding technology is known for its great efficiency and consistent quality. A four-step welding seam tracking system is suggested based on segmented scanning, filtering, feature points extraction, and path planning. Through the laser sensor installed at the end of the welding robot, the welding seam data is continuously collected in multiple segments in a segmented scanning manner. To improve the tracking accuracy, a combined filtering method is used to correct the data to reduce the effects of burrs, data distortion, and noise on the surface of the weldment. Then the feature points are collected, and the coordinate system is calibrated in order to identify the welding points. Finally, the spatial welding path is obtained by path planning. Two-dimensional type S and three-dimensional complex welding experimental investigations are carried out. The results show that the proposed method can form a complete welding path. The average errors of the two weldments are about 0.296 mm and 0.292 mm, respectively, which are close enough to fulfill the required accuracy of 0.5 mm. It shows that the proposed tracking method is effective and can provide a reference for the research of high-precision tracking and automatic welding.",ar,2023-02-01,Gongcheng Kexue Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Engineering,3D complex welding | feature points extraction | path planning | seam tracking | segmented scanning,2-s2.0-85142686578,,,Article,Cao X.P.,60028891;60027363;113006195,Chang'an University;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;Guangzhou Institute of Advanced Technology,Xi'an;Beijing;Guangzhou,China;China;China,6,"Cao, Xue Peng;Zhang, Gong;Yang, Gen;Wu, Yue Yu;Tao, Hao;Wang, Chuan Xi",55588118200;55887528500;57219265098;57223112596;57983496800;57982321000,60028891;113006195-60027363;113006195;113006195;113006195;60028891,February 2023,20959389,21100399145,,Journal,45,2,,310-317,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.13374/j.issn2095-9389.2021.09.02.001

10.1109/TRO.2022.3200156,Distributionally Robust Risk Map for Learning-Based Motion Planning and Control: A Semidefinite Programming Approach,"In this article, we propose a novel safety specification tool, called the distributionally robust risk map (DR-risk map), for a mobile robot operating in a learning-enabled environment. Given the robot's position, the map aims to reliably assess the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of collision with obstacles whose movements are inferred by Gaussian process regression (GPR). Unfortunately, the inferred distribution is subject to errors, making it difficult to accurately evaluate the CVaR of collision. To overcome this challenge, our tool measures the risk under the worst-case distribution in a so-called ambiguity set that characterizes allowable distribution errors. To resolve the infinite-dimensionality issue inherent in the construction of the DR-risk map, we derive a tractable semidefinite programming formulation that provides an upper bound of the risk, exploiting techniques from modern distributionally robust optimization. As a concrete application for motion planning, a distributionally robust RRT∗ algorithm is considered using the risk map that addresses distribution errors caused by GPR. Furthermore, a motion control method is devised using the DR-risk map in a learning-based model predictive control (MPC) formulation. In particular, a neural network approximation of the risk map is proposed to reduce the computational cost in solving the MPC problem. The performance and utility of the proposed risk map are demonstrated through simulation studies that show its ability to ensure the safety of mobile robots despite learning errors.",ar,2023-02-01,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,Collision avoidance | motion control | motion planning | optimization | probability distribution | robustness,2-s2.0-85139430562,,,Article,Hakobyan A.,60120116,Automation and Systems Research Institute,Seoul,South Korea,2,"Hakobyan, Astghik;Yang, Insoon",57218660081;55662594900,60120116;60120116,1 February 2023,15523098,95101,19410468,Journal,39,1,,718-737,0,NRF,MSIT2020-0-00857,Samsung,3,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2022.3200156

The keyframes, labeled with some time stamps, are the desired task-space outputs, which a robot is expected to follow sequentially. The time stamps of the keyframes can be different from the time of the robot's actual execution. The method jointly finds an objective function and a time-warping function such that the robot's resulting trajectory sequentially follows the keyframes with minimal discrepancy loss. The Continuous PDP minimizes the discrepancy loss using projected gradient descent by efficiently solving the gradient of the robot trajectory with respect to the unknown parameters. The method is first evaluated on a simulated robot arm and then applied to a 6-DoF quadrotor to learn an objective function for motion planning in unmodeled environments.

The proposed navigational controller is developed by hybridizing the metaheuristic moth-flame optimization (MFO) approach and the reinforcement learning (RL) approach. Input parameters like obstacle and target locations are fed to the MFO controller that implements a proper navigational direction selection. It forwards to the RL controller, which exercises further refinement of the output turning angle around obstacles. The collaboration of the global MFO approach with the local-based RL approach helps to optimize the path traversed by the humanoid robot in an unknown environment. The major breakthrough in this article is the utilization of humanoid robots for navigation purposes between various checkpoints. The humanoid robots are placed in a cluttered environment and assigned specific target positions to complete the assigned tasks. In the case of a multi-humanoid robot system, to avoid self-collision, it requires a Petri-Net controller to be configured in the navigation system to prevent deadlock situations and enhance the smooth completion of tasks without inter-collision among the humanoid robots. Simulations and real-time experiments are undertaken using different controllers involving single- and multi-humanoid robot systems. The robustness of the proposed controller is also validated in dynamic environment.

The risk of network intrusions also rises as a result of these additional connected vulnerabilities. One method for detecting attacks and anomalies in the network is the intrusion detection system (IDS). But an efficient IDS is defined by two characteristics i.e., computational efficiency and classification efficiency with less false alarm rates, which can be achieved by preprocessing network traffic and identification of essential features. A k-nearest neighbor-(KNN) algorithm was used prominently in the development of network IDS due to its better detection rates. But it is very challenging to pick up an appropriate K-value for KNN and especially, when the data classes are imbalanced. Additionally, KNN is a lazy classifier since it does not learn a discriminative function from the training samples instead it memorizes them. This paper focuses on improving existing KNN classifier to achieve classification efficiency and speed in the execution of intrusion detection process. An improvement in shallow KNN is proposed by arranging the attributes of the data in a way that the sample data that is pertinent to distance computation, followed by quantification, and indexing nearest neighbors of the data block. The design and development of the proposed modified KNN driven IDS is carried out using python programming language executed on Anaconda distribution.

They are then synthesized into an uncertainty-separated control barrier function (US-CBF), which serves as hard constraints in quadratic programming (QP) based controller. To handle the dynamic uncertainties, we exploit another GP to learn the residual dynamics of the robot. The mean prediction is then feedforwarded to the controller such that the residual dynamics can be compensated. The variance function is incorporated into the QP to constrain the trajectory of the robot within a high-confidence safety tube. Moreover, we prove that the solution to the QP is locally Lipschitz continuous, which guarantees a unique solution to the system. Our proposed method demonstrates good performance in addressing safe navigation tasks in highly very complex scenarios provided by the KITTI dataset. Additionally, its reliability and safety assurance have been verified in real-world scenarios using a quadrotor under external wind disturbance.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Collision avoidance | Gaussian Process | Gaussian processes | Kernel | Model Learning for Control | Noise measurement | Robot Safety | Robots | Safety | Uncertainty | Uncertainty Synthesis,2-s2.0-85170532968,,,Article,Li J.,60019722;60019118;60003892,Technische Universität München;University of Science and Technology of China;Arizona State University,Munich;Hefei;Tempe,Germany;China;United States,5,"Li, Jiacheng;Liu, Qingchen;Jin, Wanxin;Qin, Jiahu;Hirche, Sandra",58571066700;56949199300;56028119700;35792326900;15725278100,60019118;60019118;60003892;60019118;60019722,2023,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2023.3309130
10.1017/S0263574723001182,Single and multiple humanoid path planning using Hill valley approach applied to gravitational drift in Gravitational search algorithm,"In this paper, the Hill Valley (HV) approach is applied to the drifting masses or agents in the basic Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) for the path planning of humanoid robots. The drift in lighter masses toward the heavier mass creates a localized area, where the probability of obtaining a globally optimal solution is very high. So, the present work is focused on exploiting the area to tackle local optima and provide the best steering angle for the humanoids to navigate. The HV approach is applied to the basic GSA model, at the later stages, to improve the overall computational time and cost. The robustness of the proposed controller was tested in both simulation and experimental environments and compared with the previous research. The results obtained from the proposed controller showed a significant improvement in the overall path length and time taken. Path smoothness was also given equal importance during path planning to ensure stability. The multi-robot navigational scheme was performed using the Dining Philosopher's model to avoid dynamic collision among the humanoids. The percentage deviation in the results was within the acceptable limits. To further check the effectiveness of the proposed technique, the proposed approach was compared with the vision-based navigation in danger space.",ar,2023-01-01,Robotica,Dining Philosopher's model | Gravity search algorithm | Hill Valley approach | Humanoid navigation | Hybrid techniques,2-s2.0-85170030913,S0263574723001182,,Article,Vikas ,60000934,National Institute of Technology Rourkela,Rourkela,India,2,"Vikas, ;Parhi, Dayal R.",57653604900;6603245659,60000934;60000934,2023,02635747,18078,14698668,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0263574723001182
10.3389/fnbot.2023.1200214,Deep reinforcement learning-aided autonomous navigation with landmark generators,"Mobile robots are playing an increasingly significant role in social life and industrial production, such as searching and rescuing robots, autonomous exploration of sweeping robots, and so on. Improving the accuracy of autonomous navigation of mobile robots is a hot issue to be solved. However, traditional navigation methods are unable to realize crash-free navigation in an environment with dynamic obstacles, more and more scholars are gradually using autonomous navigation based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to replace overly conservative traditional methods. But on the other hand, DRL's training time is too long, and the lack of long-term memory easily leads the robot to a dead end, which makes its application in the actual scene more difficult. To shorten training time and prevent mobile robots from getting stuck and spinning around, we design a new robot autonomous navigation framework which combines the traditional global planning and the local planning based on DRL. Therefore, the entire navigation process can be transformed into first using traditional navigation algorithms to find the global path, then searching for several high-value landmarks on the global path, and then using the DRL algorithm to move the mobile robot toward the designated landmarks to complete the final navigation, which makes the robot training difficulty greatly reduced. Furthermore, in order to improve the lack of long-term memory in deep reinforcement learning, we design a feature extraction network containing memory modules to preserve the long-term dependence of input features. Through comparing our methods with traditional navigation methods and reinforcement learning based on end-to-end depth navigation methods, it shows that while the number of dynamic obstacles is large and obstacles are rapidly moving, our proposed method is, on average, 20% better than the second ranked method in navigation efficiency (navigation time and navigation paths' length), 34% better than the second ranked method in safety (collision times), 26.6% higher than the second ranked method in success rate, and shows strong robustness.",ar,2023-01-01,Frontiers in Neurorobotics,autonomous navigation | deep reinforcement learning (DRL) | mobile robots | simultaneous localization and mapping | trajectory planning,2-s2.0-85169703112,,,Article,Wang X.,60009400,Nanjing University of Post and TeleCommunications,Nanjing,China,5,"Wang, Xuanzhi;Sun, Yankang;Xie, Yuyang;Bin, Jiang;Xiao, Jian",58292548200;58292684000;58292970100;58561709600;57202507293,60009400;60009400;60009400;60009400;60009400,2023,,21100199837,16625218,Journal,17,,1200214,,1,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbot.2023.1200214

10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3311023,Local Path Planning: Dynamic Window Approach with Q-learning Considering Congestion Environments for Mobile Robot,"In recent years, autonomous mobile robots have significantly increased in prevalence due to their ability to augment and diversify the workforce. One critical aspect of their operation is effective local path planning, which considers dynamic constraints. In this context, the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) has been widely recognized as a robust local path planning. DWA produces a set of path candidates derived from velocity space subject to dynamic constraints. An optimal path is selected from path candidates through an evaluation function guided by fixed weight coefficients. However, fixed weight coefficients are typically designed for a specific environmental context. Consequently, changes in environmental conditions such as congestion levels, road width, and obstacle density could potentially lead the evaluation function to select inefficient paths or even result in collisions. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes the dynamic weight coefficients based on Q-learning for DWA (DQDWA). The proposed method uses a pre-learned Q-table that comprises robot states, environmental conditions, and actions of weight coefficients. DQDWA can use the pre-learned Q-table to dynamically select optimal paths and weight coefficients that better adapt to varying environmental conditions. The performance of DQDWA was validated through extensive simulations and real experiments to confirm its ability to enhance the effectiveness of local path planning.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Access,Angular velocity | Collision avoidance | collision avoidance | dynamic window approach | mobile robot | Mobile robots | motion planning | Path planning | Path planning | Q-learning | Robot kinematics | Robots,2-s2.0-85169697835,,,Article,Kobayashi M.,60024322;60011418,Osaka University;Kobe University,Suita;Kobe,Japan;Japan,4,"Kobayashi, Masato;Zushii, Hiroka;Nakamura, Tomoaki;Motoi, Naoki",57202046715;58561762300;58128037600;14834127400,60024322;60011418;60011418;60011418,2023,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,,,,,1,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3311023

However, dimensional deviations from intended values and inadequate surface quality of the built parts limit its wide deployment. The present work reports the development of an adaptive tool path trajectory platform to correct the dimensional inaccuracies in-situ to build high-quality components using LDED. The study deploys a laser line scanner to scan the part after the deposition of the definite number of layers followed by the detection of concave, convex, and flat surfaces using deep learning. Further, a novel adaptive trajectory planning algorithm is deployed by using three different strategies to control material deposition on concave, convex, and flat surfaces. The material deposition is controlled by using adaptive scanning speed control (ASSC), and a combination of laser on–off and scanning speed control (ASSLC). Subsequently, the built geometries are subjected to geometric, microstructure, and mechanical characterizations. It is observed that the deviation of the part was reduced by 30%, and 27.5% using ASSC and ASSLC, respectively. The structures built using the three strategies show some micropores at isolated locations. The microstructure is mainly cellular under all conditions with a similar average microhardness of ~ 210 HV.

10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3307573,Bidirectional Model-Based Policy Optimization Based on Adaptive Gaussian Noise and Improved Confidence Weights,"Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) has been gradually applied in the field of Robot Learning due to its excellent sample efficiency and asymptotic performance. However, for high-dimensional learning tasks in complex scenes, the exploration and stable training capabilities of the robot still need enhancement. In light of policy planning and policy optimization, we propose a bidirectional model-based policy optimization algorithm based on adaptive gaussian noise and improved confidence weights (BMPO-NW). The algorithm parameterizes bidirectional policy networks into noise networks by adding different adaptive Gaussian noises to the connection weights and biases. This can improve the randomness of policy search and induce efficient exploration for the robot. Simultaneously, the confidence weight of improved activation function is introduced into the Q-function update formula of SAC, which can reduce the error propagation problem of target Q-network, and enhance the robot's training stability. Finally, we implement the improved algorithm based on the framework of bidirectional model-based policy optimization algorithm (BMPO) to ensure asymptotic performance and sample efficiency. Experimental results in MuJoCo benchmark environments demonstrate that the learning speed of BMPO-NW is about 20% higher than baseline methods, the average reward is about 15% higher than other MBRL methods, and 50%-70% higher than MFRL methods, while the training process is more stable.

We consider two complementary scenarios: for simpler sparse environments, we formulate the Quantum Full Path Search Algorithm (q-FPS), which creates a superposition of full random path solutions, manipulates probability amplitudes with Quantum Amplitude Amplification (QAA), and quantum measures a single obstacle free full path solution. For dense unstructured environments, we formulate the Quantum Rapidly Exploring Random Tree algorithm, q-RRT, that creates quantum superpositions of possible parent-child connections, manipulates probability amplitudes with QAA, and quantum measures a single reachable state, which is added to a tree. As performance depends on the number of oracle calls and the probability of measuring good quantum states, we quantify how these errors factor into the probabilistic completeness properties of the algorithm. We then numerically estimate the expected number of database solutions to provide an approximation of the optimal number of oracle calls in the algorithm. We compare the q-RRT algorithm with a classical implementation and verify quadratic run-time speedup in the largest connected component of a 2D dense random lattice.

However, the risk of collision between robots varies as they move and communication may not always be needed. This paper presents an efficient communication method that addresses the problem of “when” and “with whom” to communicate in multi-robot collision avoidance scenarios. In this approach, each robot learns to reason about other robots’ states and considers the risk of future collisions before asking for the trajectory plans of other robots. We introduce a new neural architecture for the learned communication policy which allows our method to be scalable. We evaluate and verify the proposed communication strategy in simulation with up to twelve quadrotors, and present results on the zero-shot generalization/robustness capabilities of the policy in different scenarios.

This algorithm enables the robot to avoid obstacles, find the optimal path, and complete automatic charging docking. It maintains the global completeness and path optimality of the RRT algorithm while also improving the iteration speed and quality of generated paths in both 2D and 3D path planning.

10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3303873,Logarithmic Potential Field: A New Leader- Follower Robotic Control Mechanism to Enhance the Execution Speed and Safety Attributes,"The leader-follower formation approach is a commonly used strategy in multi-robot systems, usually implemented with a hierarchical control architecture combining path planning and formation control. The leader robot determines the desired trajectory while the follower robots track the motion of the leader robot using a control system. However, this hierarchical architecture does not ensure successful obstacle avoidance for follower robots. Several solutions proposed adding an obstacle avoidance layer, but this can increase the system complexity and reduce the computational speed, hindering real-time performance. Improving the opposing attributes, namely the execution speed, path length, safety, and smoothness, together is a challenging path-planning problem in robotics. This paper proposes a novel leader-follower control mechanism that combines formation control and obstacle avoidance in one step. The new path planning technique focuses on enhancing execution speed and safety while ensuring the generation of smooth paths with acceptable path lengths. The main contribution of the proposed technique lies in the development of a novel potential field modeling approach specifically designed for follower robots in a multi-robot system. The proposed potential field model consists of three terms, namely, the Gaussian term, the Euclidean term, and the Logarithmic term, which are all optimized later using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to generate the path. The Gaussian term, acting as a repulsive force, represents the Gaussian distance to each obstacle in the environment. It exhibits a strong value in close proximity to obstacles, while it gradually decays exponentially as the distance from the obstacles increases. The second term, the Euclidean term, which is the Euclidean distance to the leader robot, is responsible to find the shortest path to the leader robot. Finally, to ensure follower robot safety, a logarithmic term is integrated into the potential field model, facilitating automatic switching between attractive and repulsive forces generated by the leader robot. The incorporation of a logarithmic term into the potential field model stands as a significant innovation in the proposed technique. This inclusion enables the leader robot to generate an initial attractive force towards the followers, which dynamically transitions into a repulsive force as the follower robots approach. This automatic switching behavior enhances processing efficiency while ensuring collision avoidance. A kinematic control strategy is applied to the system in order to test the proposed path planning technique. The experimental results have proven the effectiveness of the proposed system, which has shown superior performance over the well-known techniques A∗, RRT∗, PRM, and also Hybrid-A∗ in terms of execution speed and the path length.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Access,kinematic control | leader-follower | Multi-robot | path planning | potential field,2-s2.0-85167836332,,,Article,Fareh R.,60070813;60004582;100544721,University of Sharjah;King Abdulaziz University;Collège Ahuntsic,Sharjah;Jeddah;Montreal,United Arab Emirates;Saudi Arabia;Canada,5,"Fareh, Raouf;Baziyad, Mohammed;Khadraoui, Sofiane;Brahmi, Brahim;Bettayeb, Maamar",27567713000;57194114646;36975456200;57193153269;7003970897,60070813;60070813;60070813;100544721;60070813-60004582,2023,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,11,,,85451-85466,1,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3303873

Integrating robotic welding with high-value manufacturing sector makes volume rise through pre-programmed repetitive performance on desired welding space. Further, the establishment of fully automated robotic-based welding operations with different configurations on controlled localization is the least available due to unviable cost. Hence, the proposed work concentrates on internet of things (IoT)-driven robotic tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding on stainless steel (SS) 304 by incorporating online programming (OP) with visual control schemes to classify the nature of weld quality using an artificial neural network. Continuous sensory-guided techniques with IoT high-level operator interface affords automated welding planning by using feature matching strategies. Area scan-based complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) cameras have been used to capture passive vision real-time images of the weld species for defect classification. In real-time, discrete reference workpiece and image feature extraction processes seem to be complicated in an unstructured welding environment. Hence, the present idea will enhance the efficiency of high product variance, but the accuracy of the automation relies on the weld image database. The proposed method (a) adaptively regulates its welding parameter variation on the welding trajectory path, (b) adapts and produces precise good weld workpieces with a 92% production rate with flaw-free welds and (c) initiates the automatic tuning of robot kinematics through IoT closed-loop online external control strategy.

10.1002/rob.22236,Geometry-based flipper motion planning for articulated tracked robots traversing rough terrain in real-time,"Tracked robots operating on rough terrain are often equipped with controllable flippers to help themselves overcome large obstacles or gaps. How to automate the control of these auxiliary flippers to achieve autonomous traversal remains an open question, which still necessitates inefficient manual teleoperation in practice. To tackle this problem, this article presents a geometry-based motion planning method for an articulated tracked robot to self-control its flippers during autonomous or semiautonomous traversal over rough terrain in urban search and rescue environments. The proposed method is developed by combining dynamic programming with a novel geometry-based pose prediction method of high computational efficiency, which is applicable for typical challenging rescue terrains, such as stairs, Stepfields, and rails. The efficient pose prediction method allows us to make thousands of predictions about the robot poses at future locations for given flipper configurations within the onboard sensor range. On the basis of such predictions, our method evaluates the entire discretized configuration space and thereby determines the optimal flipper motion online for a smooth traversal over the terrain. The overall planning algorithm is tested with both simulated and real-world robots and compared with a reinforcement-learning-based method using the RoboCup Rescue Robot League standard testing scenarios. The experimental results show that our method enables the robots to automatically control the flippers, successfully go over challenging terrains, and outperform the baseline method in passing smoothness and robustness to different terrains.",ar,2023-01-01,Journal of Field Robotics,geometry-based pose prediction | motion planning | semiautonomous traversal | tracked robot,2-s2.0-85166905887,,,Article,Chen B.,60024350,National University of Defense Technology China,Changsha,China,8,"Chen, Bailiang;Huang, Kaihong;Pan, Hainan;Ren, Haoran;Chen, Xieyuanli;Xiao, Junhao;Wu, Wenqi;Lu, Huimin",57204641798;55842050700;58482018700;57576058100;57193685774;49964924600;58524738500;55729801700,60024350;60024350;60024350;60024350;60024350;60024350;60024350;60024350,2023,15564959,4700152301,15564967,Journal,,,,,0,NSFC,62203460,National Natural Science Foundation of China,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1002/rob.22236

When the interaction semantic is definite, manually guiding the manipulator is a commonly used method to teach robots how to interact with objects. However, the learning results are robot-dependent because the mechanical parameters are different for different robots, which means the learning process must be executed again. Moreover, during the manual guiding process, operators are responsible for recognizing the region being contacted and providing expert motion programming, which limits the robot&#x0027;s intelligence. To enhance the level of automation in object interaction for robots, this paper proposes IRMT-Net (Interaction Region and Motion Trajectory prediction Network) to predict the interaction region and motion trajectory simultaneously based on images.

10.1109/TASE.2023.3297176,Learning-Based Risk-Bounded Path Planning Under Environmental Uncertainty,"Building a general and efficient path planning framework in uncertain nonconvex environments is challenging due to the safety constraints and complex configuration. Traditional avenues usually involve convexifying obstacles and presume Gaussian distribution, which are not universal. Meanwhile, the fast convergence of high-quality solutions is not guaranteed. Therefore, we develop a novel neural risk-bounded path planner to quickly find near-optimal solutions that have an acceptable collision probability in the complex environments. Firstly, we retrieve the nonconvex obstacles with arbitrary probabilistic uncertainties in the form of a deterministic point cloud map. A neural network sampler encodes it into a latent embedding and is trained with sufficient expert demonstrations, predicting states in the potential subspace. We construct a neural cost estimator to select the best informed state from those samples. Then, we recursively use the simple yet effective neural networks to march toward the start and goal bidirectionally. The collision risk of the intermediate connections is verified based on sum-of-squares optimization. Simulation results show that our approach significantly saves time and resources in finding comparable solutions over the state-of-the-art methods in the seen and unseen challenging environments. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;More and more robots are deployed in unstructured environments, such as forests and subterranean caves. However, uncertainty in the environment situational awareness usually causes accidents. To quickly generate safe paths without over-conservation in uncertain complex environments, we propose a neural risk-bounded sampling-based path planner. Conventional methods consume lots of computation time and resources to generate satisfactory results. Our learning-based risk-bounded path planning framework can efficiently find paths with a guaranteed risk tolerance avoiding uncertain nonconvex static obstacles. It imitates the expert to generate informed states in a subspace that potentially contains the optimal solution. In practice, we need to formulate the observed uncertain obstacle at a grid map into the polynomial containing random variables and determine their probability distributions.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Collision avoidance | deep learning methods | Path planning | Planning | Probabilistic logic | risk-bounded path planning | Robots | Sampling-based algorithm | Three-dimensional displays | Uncertainty,2-s2.0-85166748955,,,Article,Meng F.,60105683;60021032;60002798,Southern University of Science and Technology;School of Electrical and Computer Engineering;Chinese University of Hong Kong,Shenzhen;Atlanta;Hong Kong,China;United States;Hong Kong,5,"Meng, Fei;Chen, Liangliang;Ma, Han;Wang, Jiankun;Meng, Max Q.H.",57275364300;57204417783;57214759136;57200020647;7102739136,60002798;60021032;60002798;60105683;60002798,2023,15455955,17340,15583783,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2023.3297176

10.1007/s11265-023-01883-7,FPGA Design of Transposed Convolutions for Deep Learning Using High-Level Synthesis,"Deep Learning (DL) is pervasive across a wide variety of domains. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are often used for image processing DL applications. Modern CNN models are growing to meet the needs of more sophisticated tasks, e.g. using Transposed Convolutions (TCONVs) for image decompression and image generation. Such state-of-the-art DL models often target GPU-based high-performance architectures, due to the high computational and hardware resource needs of TCONV layers. To avoid prohibitive GPU energy costs, CNNs are increasingly deployed to decentralized embedded autonomous devices, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). However, this poses challenges for designing efficient hardware implementations of TCONV layers. This paper presents a parameterized design and implementation of a new TCONV module, which is synthesizable onto FPGAs. It is implemented using the High-Level Synthesis (HLS), through a C++ template to parameterize its functional and non-functional properties. These parameters allow kernel sizes, image sizes, quantization and parallelism to be varied by users. With a systematic exploration in this design space, we find an optimal instance of this TCONV module that achieves 6.25 Giga Outputs per Second (Gout/s) using just 1.53 W of power. We then use our TCONV layer in two neural networks for image decompression and image generation. Image decompression achieves a speed throughput of more than 30K frames-per-second (fps) using only the 16% of resources on average, image generation achieves an energy efficiency of 324 fps/W and outperforms comparable state-of-the-art models by at least 7.3×.",ar,2023-01-01,Journal of Signal Processing Systems,Deep Learning | FPGA | High-Level Synthesis | Parallelism | Quantization | Transposed Convolution,2-s2.0-85166632510,,,Article,Sestito C.,60027272;60020261;60019656,The University of Edinburgh;Università della Calabria;Heriot-Watt University,Edinburgh;Rende;Edinburgh,United Kingdom;Italy;United Kingdom,3,"Sestito, Cristian;Perri, Stefania;Stewart, Robert",57218937279;7006436281;53164860300,60020261-60027272;60020261;60019656,2023,19398018,11400153333,19398115,Journal,,,,,1,MIUR,undefined,"Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca",0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11265-023-01883-7

However, most educational results of this instructional method have been achieved in face-to-face educational settings and less has been said about how to promote AL and experimentation for online engineering education. Then, the main aim of this study was to create an AL methodology to learn electronics, physical computing (PhyC), programming, and basic robotics in engineering through hands-on activities and active experimentation in online environments. N = 56 students of two engineering programs (Technology in Electronics and Industrial Engineering) participated in the methodology that was conceived using the guidelines of the integrated course design model (ICDM) and in some courses combining mobile and online learning with an Android app. The methodology gathered three main components: (1) In-home laboratories performed through low-cost hardware devices, (2) Student-created videos and blogs to evidence the development of skills, and (3) Teacher support and feedback. Data in the courses were collected through surveys, evaluation rubrics, semistructured interviews, and students' grades and were analyzed through a mixed approach. The outcomes indicate a good perception of the PhyC and programming activities by the students and suggest that these influence motivation, self-efficacy, reduction of anxiety, and improvement of academic performance in the courses. Even, the PhyC activities can reduce the differences in academic performance between women and male students and promote their improvement toward excellence with better results for courses combining online and mobile learning.

Thus, it is important that K-8 pre-service teachers of all subjects are both prepared and motivated to teach computer science concepts—such as programming—upon entering the field. However, little is known about how pre-service teachers learn and retain programming knowledge or obtain and sustain their motivation related to programming. Maker-focused educational robotics activities have the potential to both reduce abstract cognitive load and work as motivational tools for STEM learning. The purpose of this study was to examine pre-service teachers’ motivational persistence and retention of programming concepts after learning with educational robotics through maker-focused computer science activities. Hands-on maker robotics programming activities were used to teach and motivate pre-service teachers. This quantitative study utilized repeated measures through pre-, post-, and 6-month follow-up surveys and tests. The findings indicated the pre-service teachers’ programming comprehension gains exhibited on the posttest deteriorated substantially to near-baseline levels within 6 months of instruction. Conversely, pre-service teachers’ motivation related to programming continued to rise after the instruction had concluded. Both the retention of comprehension of programming concepts and motivational persistence findings imply that educator preparation providers should integrate programming instruction throughout their pre-service teacher curricula and support curricular initiatives that call for the integration of computer science instruction across pre-service teacher methods courses to reinforce computer science learning.",ar,2023-01-01,Educational Technology Research and Development,Maker | Pre-service teachers | Programming | Robotics | Teacher education,2-s2.0-85166236113,,,Article,Fegely A.,60029255;60019213,Tennessee Technological University;Coastal Carolina University,Cookeville;Conway,United States;United States,3,"Fegely, Alex;Gleasman, Cory;Kolski, Tammi",57190960375;57211298665;57208402750,60019213;60029255;60019213,2023,10421629,20764,15566501,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-023-10273-6

As recent explorations of ‘machine vision’ in robotics demonstrate, cameras can be understood as instruments of capture and representation which no longer are simply recorders of images whose meanings are to be unlocked by human interpreters. Moving across a range of performative contexts, from anthropologists Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead’s ethnographic work in Bali to experiments with an autonomous android in the Japanese lab, the article explores the camera as a cybernetically influenced sensing device that generates complex feedback loops between entities and their spatio-temporal environments. How does the camera as a sensing device enact a kind of visual performativity whereby technologically mediated subjects and selves are not recorded but, in effect, produced through interactive circuits, instruments and computational technologies? How might models of perception and observation that emerge from the social and natural sciences shape new ideas about the entangling of computational and real bodies spaces in the emerging practices of performance design?.",ar,2023-01-01,Theatre and Performance Design,,2-s2.0-85166027933,,,Article,Salter C.,60189445;60025272,Zurich University of the Arts;The University of Tokyo,Zurich;Tokyo,Switzerland;Japan,2,"Salter, Chris;Ikegami, Takashi",58379695700;58510252500,60189445;60025272,2023,23322551,21100887524,23322578,Journal,9,1-2,,91-111,0,FRQSC,22H04858,Fonds de Recherche du Québec-Société et Culture,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1080/23322551.2023.2207966
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3298602,Data Homogenization Method for Heterogeneous Sensors Applied to Reinforcement Learning,"In autonomous navigation and route planning, the data obtained by the different sensors play a significant role. On the one hand, more data will lead to faster learning of the behavioral policy. On the other hand, agents equipped with different sensors will need more computing power to process the data, thus requiring more robust equipment and increasing the cost of implementation. In addition, the complexity of the algorithms increases as different types of data, i.e., data with different structures, have to be synchronized. Therefore, this paper addresses the problem of homogenization and synchronization of data provided by heterogeneous sensors. Furthermore, it presents a novel method of estimating data in order to provide the agent with a 360-degree view of the environment, similar to that provided by a laser. The method's performance compares the different behavioral policies obtained by different viewing angles of a camera with the policy obtained by a laser. The data obtained from the different viewing angles of each sensor are used in a path planning algorithm, which was designed to use a single 24-scan laser as an input source. The results show that the proposed method is robust since the behavior policies can be reused regardless of the viewing angle with which the sensor (camera) is provided. Furthermore, the proposed novel algorithm achieves an average efficiency of 68% and 94% using a 90 and 360-degree camera, respectively.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Access,Artificial intelligence | heterogeneous data | homogeneous data | interpolation | laser scan | point cloud | reinforcement learning,2-s2.0-85165925463,,,Article,Palacios-Morocho E.,60117547,Instituto de Telecomunicaciones y Aplicaciones Multimedia,Valencia,Spain,4,"Palacios-Morocho, Elizabeth;Lopez-Munoz, Pablo;Costan, Manuel A.;Monserrat, Jose F.",57321938100;58506690500;58507798200;15127624000,60117547;60117547;60117547;60117547,2023,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,11,,,77347-77358,1,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3298602
10.1109/TCCN.2023.3298926,Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation Based on DT-MEC-Assisted Federated Learning Framework,"Traditional centralized machine learning uses a large amount of data for model training, which may face some privacy and security problems. On the other hand, federated learning (FL), which focuses on privacy protection, also faces challenges such as core network congestion and limited mobile device (MD) resources. The computation offloading technology of mobile edge computing (MEC) can effectively alleviate these challenges, but it ignores the effect of user mobility and the unpredictable MEC environment. In this paper, we first propose an architecture that combines digital twin (DT) and MEC technology with the FL framework, where the DT network can virtually imitate the statue of physical entities (PEs) and network topology to be used for real-time data analysis and network resource optimization. The computation offloading technology of MEC is used to alleviate resource constraints of MDs and the core network congestion. We further leverage the FL to construct DT models based on PEs&#x2019; running data. Then, we jointly optimize the problem of computation offloading and resource allocation to reduce the straggler effect in FL based on the framework. Since the solution of the objective function is a stochastic programming problem, we model a markov decision process (MDP), and use the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to solve this objective function. The simulation results prove the feasibility of the proposed scheme, and the scheme can significantly reduce the total cost by about 50% and improve the communication performance compared with baseline schemes.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking,Computation offloading | Computational modeling | deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) | federated learning | Internet of Things | Optimization | resource allocation | Resource management | Servers | Task analysis | Training,2-s2.0-85165924710,,,Article,He Y.,60195969;60078684;60000937,Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence;A.

In particular, evaluating the degree of intramuscular fat (IMF) in tissue sections is a challenging task, which today is still mostly performed qualitatively or quantitatively by a highly subjective and error-prone manual analysis. We here realize the mission to make automated IMF analysis possible that (i) minimizes subjectivity, (ii) provides accurate and quantitative results quickly, and (iii) is cost-effective using standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained tissue sections. To address all these needs in a deep learning approach, we utilized the convolutional encoder-decoder network SegNet to train the specialized network IMFSegNet allowing to accurately quantify the spatial distribution of IMF in histological sections. Our fully automated analysis was validated on 17 H&E-stained muscle sections from individual sheep and compared to various state-of-the-art approaches. Not only does IMFSegNet outperform all other approaches, but this neural network also provides fully automated and highly accurate results utilizing the most cost-effective procedures of sample preparation and imaging. Furthermore, we shed light on the opacity of black-box approaches such as neural networks by applying an explainable artificial intelligence technique to clarify that the success of IMFSegNet actually lies in identifying the hard-to-detect IMF structures. Embedded in our open-source visual programming language JIPipe that does not require programming skills, it can be expected that IMFSegNet advances muscle condition assessment in basic research across multiple areas as well as in research fields focusing on translational clinical applications.",ar,2023-01-01,Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal,Biomedical image analysis | Deep Learning | Explainable artificial intelligence | H&amp;E staining | Intramuscular fat | Muscle biopsies,2-s2.0-85165890374,S2001037023002672,,Article,Praetorius J.P.,60072518;60029507;60023251,Hans-Knoll-Institute (HKI);Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena;Universitätsklinikum Jena und Medizinische Fakultät,Jena;Jena;Jena,Germany;Germany;Germany,5,"Praetorius, Jan Philipp;Walluks, Kassandra;Svensson, Carl Magnus;Arnold, Dirk;Figge, Marc Thilo",57222709923;55503303900;56720123800;7401509323;6603914586,60072518-60029507;60072518-60029507;60072518;60023251;60072518-60029507,January 2023,,21100318415,20010370,Journal,21,,,3696-3704,1,DFG,210879364,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2023.07.031

Even if the autonomous robot successfully achieves long-horizon goals, users find it difficult to trust their decision-making process. To increase user trust in the decision-making process when an autonomous robot executes a long-horizon task, this paper proposes an algorithm that empowers the autonomous agent to explain to users the transition from the current state to the target state in a continuous state space, as well as to explain the errors in user estimates. A framework that uses a graph-based world model is proposed to identify important nodes and reachability between nodes in the decision-making process; based on these nodes and reachability, the model generates the required explanations. To validate our proposed method's ability to generate long-horizon plans and explanations, we conducted experiments in PointMaze environments. Our simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our approach in generating reliable world models for long-horizon tasks.

To address this issue, we proposed a new motion planning framework named experience-driven random tree connect with human demonstration (ERTC-HD), which can facilitate the identification of valid motions in cluttered environments by only using human skeleton information extracted from a single red, green, and blue (RGB) camera. The concept of this framework is to only extract the comprehensive features of human motion from unreliable demonstrations and use it as a rough clue for solving difficult planning problems instead of as a strict solution. During the process of ERTC-HD, robot motions generated from extracted comprehensive features of human motion are saved as a path experience and modified through the path adaptation process of the existing ERTC planner when transferring it to the new problem. The results of three simulation experiments revealed that the ERTC-HD could identify valid motion in cluttered environments within a shorter time than other state-of-the-art planners, even when using unreliable demonstration data collected by a single RGB camera.

Pre-programming all the functionalities for robots becomes impractical, and hence, robots need to learn how to react to new events autonomously, just like humans. However, humans, unlike machines, are naturally skilled in responding to unexpected circumstances based on either experiences or observations. Hence, embedding such anthropoid behaviors into robots entails the development of neuro-cognitive models that emulate motor skills under a robot learning paradigm. Effective encoding of these skills is bound to the proper choice of tools and techniques. This survey paper studies different motion and behavior learning methods ranging from Movement Primitives (MP) to Experience Abstraction (EA), applied to different robotic tasks.

10.1109/TRO.2023.3290449,KT-BT: A Framework for Knowledge Transfer Through Behavior Trees in Multirobot Systems,"Multirobot and multiagent systems demonstrate collective (swarm) intelligence through systematic and distributed integration of local behaviors in a group. Agents sharing knowledge about the mission and environment can enhance performance at individual and mission levels. However, this is difficult to achieve, partly due to the lack of a generic framework for transferring part of the known knowledge (behaviors) between agents. This article presents a new knowledge representation framework and a transfer strategy called KT-BT: knowledge transfer through behavior trees. The KT-BT framework follows a query-response-update mechanism through an online behavior tree framework, where agents broadcast queries for unknown conditions and respond with appropriate knowledge using a condition-action-control subflow. We embed a novel grammar structure called <italic>stringBT</italic> that encodes knowledge, enabling behavior sharing. We theoretically investigate the properties of the KT-BT framework in achieving homogeneity of high knowledge across the entire group compared to a heterogeneous system without the capability of sharing their knowledge.

10.3969/j.issn.1004-132X.2023.05.007,Hierarchical Path Planning for Mobile Robots Based on Hybrid Map,"A hierarchical path planning method was proposed based on a hybrid topology-grid-metric map for mobile robots, to deal with the problems of large search space, inefficiency and low success rate of obstacle avoidance for traditional path-planning methods in a partially unknown, complex, large-scene environment. Firstly, the robot operation environments were described as a grid map and divided into several grid sub-maps. The topological framework was obtained by extracting the location relation of the sub-maps as the key nodes, and the local region of grid maps was represented elaborately to construct a hybrid topology-grid-metric map. Then, the robot’s path was planned hierarchically in the different regions of the hybrid map. Floyd algorithm was used to plan the interregional path between sub-regions on the topology map. An improved A* algorithm was proposed to search the intraregional paths of each sub-map for the grid map. The filtering strategy of extension points, the mechanism of bidirectional search, and the elimination technique of redundant waypoints were introduced to improve the efficiency and quality of path planning. And the globally optimized initial path was generated by merging several interregional and intraregional paths. Finally, a dynamic obstacle-avoidance path planning method was proposed based on the deep reinforcement learning framework for the dynamic obstacles in a partly unknown environment on the metric map. In the framework, the mechanism of value-classified experience replay was devised to increase the utilization of experience samples and the efficiency of model training. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has the high path-search efficiency and obstacle-avoidance success rate, and the generated paths are both safe and smooth.",ar,2023-01-01,Zhongguo Jixie Gongcheng/China Mechanical Engineering,hybrid map | improved A* algorithm | mobile robot | path planning | reinforcement learning,2-s2.0-85163528350,,,Article,Wu X.,60021666,Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Nanjing,China,5,"Wu, Xing;Yang, Junjie;Tang, Kai;Zhai, Jingjing;Lou, Peihuang",56440461700;57216312655;58404624200;57211282125;16022575500,60021666;60021666;60021666;60021666;60021666,2023,1004132X,22181,,Journal,34,5,,563-575,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.3969/j.issn.1004-132X.2023.05.007
10.1109/TASE.2023.3279718,Learning Robotic Milling Strategies Based on Passive Variable Operational Space Interaction Control,"This paper addresses the problem of robotic cutting during disassembly of products for materials separation and recycling. Waste handling applications differ from milling in manufacturing processes, as they engender considerable variety and uncertainty in the parameters (e.g. hardness) of materials which the robot must cut. To address this challenge, we propose a learning-based approach incorporating elements of interaction control, in which the robot can adapt key parameters, such as feed rate, depth of cut, and mechanical compliance during task execution. We show how a mathematical model of cutting mechanics, embedded in a simulation environment, can be used to rapidly train the system without needing large amounts of data from physical cutting trials. The simulation approach was validated on a real robot setup based on four case study materials with varying structural and mechanical properties. We demonstrate the proposed method minimises process force and path deviations to a level similar to offline optimal planning methods, while the average time to complete a cutting task is within 25% of the optimum, at the expense of reduced volume of material removed per pass. A key advantage of our approach over similar works is that no prior knowledge about the material is required. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;This work is motivated by challenges in emerging fields such as recycling of electric vehicles, where products such as batteries adopt a range of designs with varying physical geometry and materials. More generally, this applies when considering robotic disassembly of any unknown component where semi-destructive operations such as cutting are required. Product-to-product variation introduces challenges when planning cutting processes required to disassemble a component, as contemporary planning approaches typically require advance knowledge of the material properties, shape and desired path to select tool speed, feed and depth of cut. In this paper, we show a mathematical model of milling force embedded in a simulation environment can be used as a relatively inexpensive approach to simulate a broad spectrum of cutting processes the robot may encounter. This allows the robot to learn from experience a strategy that can select these key parameters of a milling task online without user assistance. We develop a framework for controlling a robot using this strategy that allows the stiffness of the robot arm to be modulated over time to best satisfy metrics of productivity (e.g. required cutting time), while maintaining safe interaction of the robot with its environment (e.g. by avoiding force limits), similarly to how a human operator can vary muscular tension to accomplish different tasks. We posit that the proposed method can substitute a trial-and-error strategy of selecting process parameters for disassembly of novel products, or integrated with existing planning approaches to adjust the parameters of milling tasks online.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Aerospace electronics | energy tank | interaction control | Milling | passivity-based control | Process control | Reinforcement learning | robotic milling | Robots | Solid modeling | Task analysis | Uncertainty,2-s2.0-85163484918,,,Article,Hathaway J.,60019702,University of Birmingham,Birmingham,United Kingdom,3,"Hathaway, Jamie;Rastegarpanah, Alireza;Stolkin, Rustam",57218875839;56182153700;16025500800,60019702;60019702;60019702,2023,15455955,17340,15583783,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2023.3279718
10.1109/LRA.2023.3290533,"Robot Navigation in Risky, Crowded Environments: Understanding Human Preferences","The effective deployment of robots in risky and crowded environments (RCE) requires the specification of robot plans that are consistent with humans&#x0027; behaviors. As is well known, humans perceive uncertainty and risk in a biased way, which can lead to a diversity of actions and expectations when interacting with others. To gain a better understanding of these behaviors, this work presents new data that aims to verify how these biases translate into a human navigational setting. More precisely, we conduct a novel study that recreates a COVID-19 pandemic grocery shopping scenario and asks participants to select among various paths with different levels of time-risk tradeoffs. The data shows that participants exhibit a variety of path preferences: from risky and urgent to safe and relaxed. To model users&#x0027; decision making, we evaluate three popular risk models (Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), Conditional Value at Risk (CVAR), and Expected Risk (ER). We find that CPT captures people&#x0027;s decisions more accurately than CVaR and ER, corroborating previous theoretical results that CPT is more expressive and inclusive than CVaR and ER. We also find that people&#x0027;s self assessments of risk and time-urgency do not correlate with their path preferences in RCEs. Finally, we conduct thematic analysis of custom open-ended questions to gauge interest and preferences of navigational Explainable AI (XAI) in robots. We find a large majority of participants were interested in navigation XAI and want robots that infer how users plan paths in their environment. A large majority also showed interest in understanding robot&#x0027;s intention (path plans and decisions) through various modalities like speech, touchscreen and gestures. Several participants also expressed interest in learning the rationale behind robot&#x0027;s decision through high-level explanations. Our work provides crucial XAI design insights for deployment of robots in RCEs.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Behavioral sciences | Cost accounting | Decision making | Human-Aware Motion Planning | Navigation | Robots | Standards | Uncertainty,2-s2.0-85163477879,,,Article,Suresh A.,60121660;60121653;60033252;60007776,Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering;Department of Computer Science and Engineering;U.S. Army Research Laboratory;Cornell University,San Diego;San Diego;Adelphi;Ithaca,United States;United States;United States;United States,4,"Suresh, Aamodh;Taylor, Angelique;D.Riek, Laurel;Martinez, Sonia",57205688337;57195153533;58401163600;7202228052,60033252;60007776;60121653;60121660,2023,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2023.3290533
10.1109/TASE.2023.3272739,Neural Optimal Control for Constrained Visual Servoing via Learning From Demonstration,"This paper proposes a novel optimal control scheme for constrained image based visual servoing of a robot manipulator. For a robot manipulator with an eye-on-hand configuration, visibility constraint is an essential requirement to avoid servo failure, while robot&#x2019;s actuator limits must also be satisfied. To ensure this, the constraints are modelled implicitly via learning the task and defining safe regions using expert human demonstrations via mixture of Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs). The visual servoing problem is then formulated as a closed-loop optimal control problem using these constraint model where a desired target (possibly time-varying) is obtained by acting upon the feedback from the real-time visual sensors. The visual servo control loop consists of a single network adaptive critic optimal tracking control scheme whose weights are tuned using Lyapunov stability criteria. The stability and the performance of the proposed control scheme is shown theoretically via Lyapunov approach and also verified experimentally using a seven degree of freedom (DOF) Franka Emika and six DOF Universal Robot (UR) 10 manipulator. The approach is also demonstrated on a use case scenarios in mock-up convenience store and warehouse setup. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;The applications of robots in busy warehouses, healthcare sectors and convenience store, has a big societal impact. The scenarios in these real-world problems often consist of a dynamic environment. Therefore, sensor-based localization and planning, along with satisfying robot and task constraints are needed. These naturally adds up to the programming costs in addition to the robot platform and actuation. However, modern robots need intuitive and easy programming for more pervasive in a practical societal application. In our proposed method, this sensor-based planning with environmental constraints is modelled implicitly using the Programming by Demonstration framework. The user needs to catch the robot arm by his hand and teach the task at hand, and the framework captures the task and robot constraints while generalizing to new goals. This modelling, along with cost optimal controller, generates real-time constraint aware robot manipulation trajectories for the demonstrated task in dynamic environments.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,learning from demonstration | Neural optimal control | robot manipulator | visual servoing,2-s2.0-85163452630,,,Article,Prakash R.,60118240;60104340,"Department of Cognitive Robotics, TU Delft;Indian Institute of Technology Mandi",Delft;Mandi,Netherlands;India,2,"Prakash, Ravi;Behera, Laxmidhar",57197201102;6701522952,60118240;60104340,2023,15455955,17340,15583783,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2023.3272739

In order to create conditions for meaningful teaching in and about programming in technology education, more knowledge about younger students’ pre-understanding and experiences is needed. In the light of this, the aim of this case study was to explore young pupils’ descriptions of the concept ‘programming’, in connection with being introduced to programming as a teaching content in technology education. The study is based on semi-structured interviews with 16 children in year 1 (7-year-olds) in a primary school in Sweden. In their descriptions of ‘programming’ as an activity, the pupils mainly used technological descriptions—a theory of artificial mind perspective. However, when they talked about the objects with which they associated programming, psychological descriptions—a theory of mind perspective—were more clearly present. Then, a less pronounced distinction between humans and machines was made. Anthropomorphic references were used, such as when the pupils referenced children’s culture such as movies and television programs. However, the term ‘programming’ was difficult for many of the pupils to grasp. They also had difficulty in finding a function for programming, as well as explanations and arguments for why they learn programming in school. The results of this study indicate that these 7-year-old pupils perceive ‘programming’ as something complex. This at the same time as they describe how programmed and programmed artefacts (including AI devices) are highly present in their everyday lives, in their leisure environments, and in school. This mirrors how technology has become an ‘intelligent’ and active agent, rather than a mere tool in their lives—an aspect that teachers may forget to take advantage of.",ar,2023-01-01,International Journal of Technology and Design Education,Primary school | Programming | Technology education | Theory of artificial mind | Theory of mind,2-s2.0-85162988548,,,Article,Axell C.,60009358,Linköpings Universitet,Linkoping,Sweden,2,"Axell, Cecilia;Berg, Astrid",55556546600;57211475650,60009358;60009358,2023,09577572,21389,15731804,Journal,,,,,1,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10798-023-09838-6

Aiming at the difficulty of pose and posture estimation of non-cooperative targets and the complexity of FFSM planning and control, the paper proposed an end-to-end target tracking algorithm using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. The algorithm uses raw camera images as input and directly outputs the manipulator joint velocities. To deal with the partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) problem caused by single image input, we combine the soft actor–critic algorithm with recurrent neural networks. Therefore, the velocity information of the target is introduced to transform the task into a fully observable Markov decision-making process (MDP). Our approach is completely data-driven. It avoids the position and posture estimation of non-cooperative target and the complex modeling motion planning process of FFSM. We trained and tested the algorithm by building a simulation environment in CoppeliaSim. The results showed that our approach achieved good results in active non-cooperative target tracking of FFSM systems and demonstrated the great potential of DRL algorithms in solving space tasks.",ar,2023-01-01,Transactions of the Institute of Measurement and Control,DRL | FFSM | non-cooperative target,2-s2.0-85162659952,,,Article,Lei W.,60019616,Harbin Institute of Technology,Harbin,China,2,"Lei, Wenxiao;Sun, Guanghui",57219172978;35103657700,60019616;60019616,2023,01423312,15449,14770369,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1177/01423312231177778

We propose a novel approach, Value Iteration Networks with Gated Summarization Module (GS-VIN), which incorporates two main improvements: 1) employing an Adaptive Iteration Strategy in the Value Iteration module to reduce the number of iterations; and 2) introducing a Gated Summarization module to summarize the iterative process. The adaptive iteration strategy uses larger convolution kernels with fewer iteration times, reducing network depth and increasing training stability while maintaining the accuracy of the planning process. The gated summarization module enables the network to emphasize the entire planning process, rather than solely relying on the final global planning outcome, by temporally and spatially resampling the entire planning process within the VI module. We conduct experiments on 2D grid world path-finding problems and the Atari Mr. Pac-man environment, demonstrating that GS-VIN outperforms the baseline in terms of single-step accuracy, planning success rate, and overall performance across different map sizes. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the relationship between input size, kernel size, and the number of iterations in VI-based models, which is applicable to a majority of VI-based models and offers valuable insights for researchers and industrial deployment.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Access,deep reinforcement learning | path-finding | robotics | Value iteration,2-s2.0-85162643981,,,Article,Cai J.,60122052;60023462,Southwest University;Waseda University,Chongqing;Tokyo,China;Japan,4,"Cai, Jinyu;Li, Jialong;Zhang, Mingyue;Tei, Kenji",58339863500;57222007630;58339863600;14830870300,60023462;60023462;60122052;60023462,2023,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,11,,,60407-60420,1,KAKEN,JP22KJ2935,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3286729

As a counterpart, the application of unplugged programming activities seems also to have promising potential regarding the impact on CT. The main characteristic of unplugged programming is that it comprises activities without the use of information and communication technologies (ICT). Since previous research has shown that the application of sense-reason-act (SRA) programming with different types of output demonstrated a better understanding of underlying complex programming concepts with an impact on CT, our research investigates whether the application of unplugged programming, offered via SmartGames, can also generate such a distinctive impact on developing CT. To capture the effects of the different interventions applied, a mixed-methods study was conducted among primary school students aged ten to twelve. Research data were obtained by means of a pretest–posttest questionnaire survey using the validated Computational Thinking Test (CTt), and by conducting interviews to determine the effects of CT and to ascertain identifiable learning effects. Our research indicates that unplugged programming by applying SmartGames can be a consummate regarding the development of CT, similar to SRA-programming using either robotics with tangible output or robot simulations with on-screen output. The research findings identified support our claim that the application of unplugged SmartGames shows equivalent development on CT sub-characteristics in comparison with plugged-in SRA-programming with tangible or on-screen output.

To efficiently optimize such systems, in this paper, we develop a parallel global optimization framework that combines direct search methods with parallel Bayesian optimization. It consists of an iterative global and local search that searches broadly through the entire global space for promising regions and then efficiently exploits each local promising region. We prove the asymptotic convergence properties of the proposed framework and conduct several numerical experiments to illustrate its empirical performance. We also provide a real-time control problem to illustrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;This work is motivated by a collision avoidance problem of vessels aided with onboard agent-based simulations. The simulation on one vessel can predict potential conflicts with other vessels on a pre-defined trajectory. In heavy congestion regions, the environment is highly dynamic and thus it is difficult to find a much safer alternative trajectory if collision is predicted on the current one. Moreover, for such real-time decisions, the control system should be quick in response to improve safety. The proposed metamodel based algorithm is designed for quick decision in such highly dynamic systems. The algorithm employs a decomposition of the response surface to better handle the multi-modal surface resulting from the highly dynamic environment. Specifically, it first looks at the large-scale trend globally (filter out the many local fluctuations that may otherwise trap the algorithm) to locate potential promising regions and then proceeds to this local regions for more detailed local search. To make quick decisions, it uses fast direct search algorithms in the local search phase and applies a parallel search scheme to enjoy the abundant computing power. Both the theoretical analysis and the simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can provide better decisions quickly. We also note that this algorithm is not limited to real-time control or simulation-based system. In the case where each run of the experiment is expensive and the budget is limited for the final decision and when the response function is multi-modal, this algorithm can hopefully become a quite efficient and competitive approach. The multi-modal responses have broad applications in the area of control, planning and operations research, such as robot navigating and reinforcement learning.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Computational modeling | direct search | global and local search | Heuristic algorithms | Linear programming | Numerical models | Optimization | parallel Bayesian optimization | Parallel global optimization | real-time control systems | Real-time systems | Trajectory,2-s2.0-85161047152,,,Article,Meng Q.,60105683;60017161;129808574,Southern University of Science and Technology;National University of Singapore;The Rice-Rick Digitalization PTE.

In addition, it optimizes the training time and the chosen path in terms of time and distance to the target. A hybrid method is also used in which Semi-Uniform Distributed Exploration (SUDE) is employed to determine the probability that the action is decided based on directed knowledge, hybrid knowledge, or autonomous knowledge. The performance of DDRL-EG is compared with two other algorithms in two different environments.

It plays a vital role in differential geometry, geometry processing, data analysis and machine learning. Here we present a Laplace--Beltrami operator in spatial Schwarzschild manifolds, denoted by SLBO. Since spatial Schwarzschild manifold has global coordinates, we derive two global approximated schemes of the SLBO in 3-dimensional grids and tetrahedral meshes: (1) We discretize the SLBO by the seven-point stencil finite difference method. This derives a small correction of the classical finite difference scheme, and we prove the convergence for this scheme; (2) we give and prove a correctedcotan formula of the SLBO.

Briefly, it captures the possibilities and effects of the actions of an agent applied to a specific object or, more generally, a part of the environment. This paper provides a short review of the recent developments of deep robotic affordance learning (DRAL), which aims to develop data-driven methods that use the concept of affordance to aid in robotic tasks. We first classify these papers from a reinforcement learning (RL) perspective and draw connections between RL and affordances. The technical details of each category are discussed and their limitations are identified. We further summarise them and identify future challenges from the aspects of observations, actions, affordance representation, data-collection and real-world deployment.

The existing OB methods approximately solve the intractable Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation by reinforcement learning (RL) with Bellman residual error, which has intricate actor-critic updating laws and persistence excitation requirement. To overcome this drawback, we construct the simplified RL updating laws by converting the problem to the solution of a positive-definite function, which is composed of actor-critic network weights. Then, the simplified RL updating laws can significantly reduce the controller complexity and relax the persistence excitation. Based on the barrier Lyapunov function, a barrier-type performance index function is constructed for the optimised controller under state constraints. The finite-time stability theory can guarantee the finite-time convergence property of the closed loop system without violating the prescribed constraints.

10.24138/jcomss-2022-0141,Twin Delayed DDPG based Dynamic Power Allocation for Mobility in IoRT,"The internet of robotic things (IoRT) is a modern as well as fast-evolving technology employed in abundant socio-economical aspects which connect user equipment (UE) for communication and data transfer among each other. For ensuring the quality of service (QoS) in IoRT applications, radio resources, for example, transmitting power allocation (PA), interference management, throughput maximization etc., should be efficiently employed and allocated among UE. Traditionally, resource allocation has been formulated using optimization problems, which are then solved using mathematical computer techniques. However, those optimization problems are generally nonconvex as well as nondeterministic polynomial-time hardness (NP-hard). In this paper, one of the most crucial challenges in radio resource management is the emitting power of an antenna called PA, considering that the interfering multiple access channel (IMAC) has been considered. In addition, UE has a natural movement behavior that directly impacts the channel condition between remote radio head (RRH) and UE. Additionally, we have considered two well-known UE mobility models i) random walk and ii) modified Gauss-Markov (GM). As a result, the simulation environment is more realistic and complex. A data-driven as well as model-free continuous action based deep reinforcement learning algorithm called twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) has been proposed that is the combination of policy gradient, actor-critics, as well as double deep Q-learning (DDQL). It optimizes the PA for i) stationary UE, ii) the UE movements according to random walk model, and ii) the UE movement based on the modified GM model. Simulation results show that the proposed TD3 method outperforms model-based techniques like weighted MMSE (WMMSE) and fractional programming (FP) as well as model-free algorithms, for example, deep Q network (DQN) and DDPG in terms of average sum-rate performance.",ar,2023-01-01,Journal of Communications Software and Systems,Deep Reinforcement Learning | IoRT | Power Allocation | Radio Resource Management | Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient | User Mobility,2-s2.0-85159863935,,,Article,Kabir H.,60090708,Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman,Kajang,Malaysia,3,"Kabir, Homayun;Tham, Mau Luen;Chang, Yoong Choon",57959903400;55277448200;7501843364,60090708;60090708;60090708,2023,18456421,19900191968,18466079,Journal,19,1,,19-29,1,UTAR,IPSR/RMC/UTARRF/ 2021C1/T05,Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman,1,2023,https://doi.org/10.24138/jcomss-2022-0141
10.1109/TMECH.2023.3270527,A Closed-Loop Shared Control Framework for Legged Robots,"Shared control, as a combination of human and robot intelligence, has been deemed as a promising direction toward complementing the perception and learning capabilities of legged robots. However, previous works on human&#x2013;robot control for legged robots are often limited to simple tasks, such as controlling movement direction, posture, or single-leg motion, yet extensive training of the operator is required. To facilitate the transfer of human intelligence to legged robots in unstructured environments, this article presents a user-friendly closed-loop shared control framework. The main novelty is that the operator only needs to make decisions based on the recommendations of the autonomous algorithm, without having to worry about operations or consider contact planning issues. Specifically, a rough navigation path from the operator is smoothed and optimized to generate a path with reduced traversing cost. The traversability of the generated path is assessed using fast Monte Carlo tree search, which is subsequently fed back through an intuitive image interface and force feedback to help the operator make decisions quickly, forming a closed-loop shared control. The simulation and hardware experiments on a hexapod robot show that the proposed framework gives full play to the advantages of human&#x2013;machine collaboration and improves the performance in terms of learning time from the operator, mission completion time, and success rate than comparison methods.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,Collision avoidance | Costs | Legged locomotion | Legged robots | motion planning | Planning | Robot kinematics | Robot sensing systems | Robots | shared control,2-s2.0-85159841056,,,Article,Xu P.,60103653;60030838;60019616;60012070,Aalto University;Toronto Metropolitan University;Harbin Institute of Technology;University of Leeds,Espoo;Toronto;Harbin;Leeds,Finland;Canada;China;United Kingdom,8,"Xu, Peng;Wang, Zhikai;Ding, Liang;Li, Zhengyang;Shi, Junyi;Gao, Haibo;Liu, Guangjun;Huang, Yanlong",57116974800;57219765741;55705576600;57203802256;58279217800;57204309644;9276223000;54389113100,60019616;60019616;60019616;60019616;60103653;60019616;60030838;60012070,2023,10834435,19113,1941014X,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2023.3270527
10.1587/transinf.2022DLP0057,SPSD: Semantics and Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Motion Planning for Supermarket Robot∗,"Robot motion planning is an important part of the unmanned supermarket. The challenges of motion planning in supermarkets lie in the diversity of the supermarket environment, the complexity of obstacle movement, the vastness of the search space. This paper proposes an adaptive Search and Path planning method based on the Semantic information and Deep reinforcement learning (SPSD), which effectively improves the autonomous decision-making ability of supermarket robots. Firstly, based on the backbone of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), supermarket robots process real-Time information from multi-modality sensors to realize high-speed and collision-free motion planning. Meanwhile, in order to solve the problem caused by the uncertainty of the reward in the deep reinforcement learning, common spatial semantic relationships between landmarks and target objects are exploited to define reward function. Finally, dynamics randomization is introduced to improve the generalization performance of the algorithm in the training. The experimental results show that the SPSD algorithm is excellent in the three indicators of generalization performance, training time and path planning length. Compared with other methods, the training time of SPSD is reduced by 27.42% at most, the path planning length is reduced by 21.08% at most, and the trained network of SPSD can be applied to unfamiliar scenes safely and efficiently. The results are motivating enough to consider the application of the proposed method in practical scenes.

10.1587/transinf.2022DLP0033,Semantic Path Planning for Indoor Navigation Tasks Using Multi-View Context and Prior Knowledge,"Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have significantly improved the performance of target-driven indoor navigation tasks. However, the rich semantic information of environments is still not fully exploited in previous approaches. In addition, existing methods usually tend to overfit on training scenes or objects in target-driven navigation tasks, making it hard to generalize to unseen environments. Human beings can easily adapt to new scenes as they can recognize the objects they see and reason the possible locations of target objects using their experience. Inspired by this, we propose a DRL-based target-driven navigation model, termed MVC-PK, using Multi-View Context information and Prior semantic Knowledge. It relies only on the semantic label of target objects and allows the robot to find the target without using any geometry map. To perceive the semantic contextual information in the environment, object detectors are leveraged to detect the objects present in the multi-view observations. To enable the semantic reasoning ability of indoor mobile robots, a Graph Convolutional Network is also employed to incorporate prior knowledge. The proposed MVC-PK model is evaluated in the AI2- THOR simulation environment. The results show that MVC-PK (1) significantly improves the cross-scene and cross-target generalization ability, and (2) achieves state-of-the-art performance with 15.2% and 11.0% increase in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), respectively",ar,2023-01-01,IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems,deep reinforcement learning | graph convolutional network | inteligent robot | visual semantic navigation,2-s2.0-85159764974,,,Article,Wu J.,60124572;60025063,"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception, Ministry of Education;KU Leuven",Beijing;3000 Leuven,China;Belgium,6,"Wu, Jianbing;Huang, Weibo;Hua, Guoliang;Zhang, Wanruo;Kang, Risheng;Liu, Hong",57868760900;57194873318;57190580316;57238145100;57217533393;55769747023,60124572;60124572;60124572;60124572;60025063;60124572,2023,09168532,15109,17451361,Journal,E106.D,5,,756-764,1,NSFC,62073004,National Natural Science Foundation of China,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1587/transinf.2022DLP0033

To address this problem, this study proposes a multi-step motion planner to stably extract an item by using the support relations of each object included in the clutter. This study primarily focuses on safe extraction, which allows the robot to choose the best next action based on limited observations. By estimating the support relations, we construct a collapse prediction graph to obtain the appropriate order of object extraction. Thus, the target object can be extracted without collapsing the pile. Furthermore, we show that the efficiency of the robot is improved if it uses one of its arms to extract the target object while the other supports a neighboring object. The proposed method is evaluated in real-world experiments on detecting support relations and object extraction tasks. This study makes a significant contribution because the experimental results indicate that the robot can estimate support relations based on collapse predictions and perform safe extraction in real environments.

It is difficult for space robots to keep running for a long time due to limited fuel. In addition, it is impossible to replenish the fuel for space robots at any time due to the unique working environment. Therefore, a proper path is crucial for the effective operation of the space robot. In this paper, we investigate the allocation of exploration tasks and the path planning of space robots jointly. The goal is to minimize the completion latency of exploration tasks. We propose two algorithms named subbranch insertion task allocation (SI-TA) and parallel search task allocation (PS-TA) to solve the problem. We also customize an algorithm named random path planning task allocation (RTA) as the baseline. At last, we implement extensive experiments to demonstrate that proposed algorithms can obtain lower completion latency than RTA.

Long-term rescue operations in dangerous environments challenge the rescuers' physical strength and threaten their lives. We propose a human-body reconstruction method for autonomous rescue operations with a wounded rescue robot. This method constructs a human-body model that can support a robot's autonomous rescue operations given limited scans of the injured. Most casualties lie on the ground in supine positions, so this scanning limit is typical. We propose a scanning viewpoint planning method using deep reinforcement learning and change the viewpoint with the help of a six-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic arm to obtain a complete scan of the visible surface. For successful autonomous casualty rescue, a robot must have access to a watertight human-body mesh with precise surfaces and associated semantics. To this end, we develop a neural network that predicts a completely clothed body mesh from visible point clouds.

10.2196/41498,"Participant Preferences for the Development of a Digitally Delivered Gardening Intervention to Improve Diet, Physical Activity, and Cardiovascular Health: Cross-sectional Study","Background: Low dietary intake of fruits and vegetables and physical inactivity are 2 modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Fruit and vegetable gardening can provide access to fresh produce, and many gardening activities are considered moderate physical activity. This makes gardening interventions a potential strategy for cardiovascular disease risk reduction. Previously developed gardening interventions have relied on in-person delivery models, which limit scalability and reach. Objective: The purpose of this study was to ascertain participant insight on intervention components and topics of interest to inform a digitally delivered, gardening-focused, multiple health behavior change intervention. Methods: A web-based survey was delivered via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), including quantitative and open-ended questions. Eligible participants were aged ≥20 years, could read and write in English, were US residents, and had at least a 98% MTurk task approval rating. A multilevel screening process was used to identify and exclude respondents with response inattention, poor language fluency, or suspected automated web robots (bots). Participants were asked about their interest in gardening programming, their preferences for intervention delivery modalities (1-hour expert lectures, a series of brief <5-minute videos, or in-person meetings), and what information is needed to teach new gardeners. Comparisons were made between never gardeners (NG) and ever gardeners (EG) in order to examine differences in perceptions based on prior experience. Quantitative data were summarized, and differences between groups were tested using chi-square tests. Qualitative data were coded and organized into intervention functions based on the Behavior Change Wheel. Results: A total of 465 participants were included (n=212, 45.6% NG and n=253, 54.4% EG). There was a high level of program interest overall (n=355, 76.3%), though interest was higher in EG (142/212, 67% NG; 213/253, 84.2% EG; P<.001). The majority of participants (n=282, 60.7%) preferred a series of brief <5-minute videos (136/212, 64.2% NG; 146/253, 57.7% EG; P=.16) over 1-hour lectures (29/212, 13.7% NG; 50/253, 19.8% EG; P=.08) or in-person delivery modes (47/212, 22.2% NG; 57/253, 22.5% EG; P=.93). Intervention functions identified were education and training (performing fundamental gardening and cooking activities), environmental restructuring (eg, social support), enablement (provision of tools or seeds), persuasion (offering encouragement and highlighting the benefits of gardening), and modeling (using content experts and participant testimonials). Content areas identified included the full lifecycle of gardening activities, from the fundamentals of preparing a garden site, planting and maintenance to harvesting and cooking. Conclusions: In a sample of potential web-based learners, participants were interested in a digitally delivered gardening program. They preferred brief videos for content delivery and suggested content topics that encompassed how to garden from planting to harvesting and cooking. The next step in this line of work is to identify target behavior change techniques and pilot test the intervention to assess participant acceptability and preliminary efficacy.",ar,2023-01-01,JMIR Formative Research,behavior change wheel | cardiovascular health | diet | gardening | intervention development | physical activity,2-s2.0-85158891109,,,Article,Veldheer S.,60027671;60001439;60001361,Penn State College of Medicine;Pennsylvania State University;University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine,Hershey;University Park;Pittsburgh,United States;United States;United States,7,"Veldheer, Susan;Whitehead-Zimmers, Maxfield;Bordner, Candace;Watt, Benjamin;Conroy, David E.;Schmitz, Kathryn H.;Sciamanna, Christopher",50761506400;58242517200;57219162589;58242294800;7005347626;57216601453;35553390200,60027671;60027671;60027671;60027671;60001439;60001361;60027671,2023,,21101028582,2561326X,Journal,7,,e41498,,1,NIH,KL2 TR002015,National Institutes of Health,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.2196/41498

The robots do not require global or relative position measurements and the swarm is fully decentralized and needs no infrastructure in place. Additionally, the system only requires one-hop communication over the robot network, we do not make any assumptions about the connectivity of the communication graph and the transmission of information and computation is scalable versus the number of agents. This is done by letting the agents in the swarm act as foragers or as guiding agents (beacons). We present experimental results computed for a swarm of Elisa-3 robots on a simulator, and show how the swarm self-organizes to solve a foraging problem over an unknown environment, converging to trajectories around the shortest path, and test the approach on a real swarm of Elisa-3 robots. At last, we discuss the limitations of such a system and propose how the foraging efficiency can be increased.",ar,2023-01-01,Autonomous Robots,Collective learning | Navigation | Path planning | Swarm robotics,2-s2.0-85153714628,,,Article,Adams S.,60118244,Delft Center for Systems and Control,Delft,Netherlands,3,"Adams, Steven;Jarne Ornia, Daniel;Mazo, Manuel",57224577179;57194067905;55822965073,60118244;60118244;60118244,2023,09295593,18016,15737527,Journal,,,,,1,ERC,755953,European Research Council,1,2023,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10514-023-10102-y

10.1109/TVT.2023.3267479,An AoTI-Driven Joint Sampling Frequency and Access Selection Optimization for Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks,"The freshness of system information has attracted extensive attention and has become one of the most critical Quality of Service (QoS) indicators in industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs). For practical IWSNs composed of numerous components, the system freshness for a specific task is usually related to multiple and multitype sensing data. For example, in a chemical plant fire alarm system, the system controller (SC) cannot determine the fire notification until analyzing multiple types of ambient information, such as temperature, flame, carbon dioxide, and smoke. However, most existing research on freshness metrics, such as Age of Information (AoI) or Age of Processing (AoP), only considers a single-package setting with a single type of data. Therefore, to measure the system freshness accurately in IWSNs, we propose the Age of Task-oriented Information (AoTI) for industrial tasks. It measures the time elapsed of the latest analyzed results before arriving at the receiver since the generation of any type of sampling data belonging to an industrial task. Considering the time-varying and wireless environments, we aim to minimize the long-term AoTI for IWSNs applications by jointly optimizing access selections and sampling frequencies for all sensors. We first formulate this problem as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem and then transform it into a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), which is further relaxed as an MDP using the Lagrangian method. Finally, we develop a Learning-based Access selection and Sampling frequency Control (LASC) algorithm and verify its superiority through extensive simulations.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,access selection | Age of Task-oriented Information (AoTI) | Frequency control | industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) | long-term optimization | Measurement | Quality of service | Robot sensing systems | sampling frequency control | Servers | Task analysis | Wireless sensor networks,2-s2.0-85153488692,,,Article,Ying C.,60033154;60025709;60021666,Concordia University;The University of Sydney;Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Montreal;Sydney;Nanjing,Canada;Australia;China,5,"Ying, Chen;Zhao, Zhen;Yi, Changyan;Shi, You;Cai, Jun",58196100200;57219437117;56353058800;57455494300;57193322474,60021666;60025709;60021666;60021666;60033154,2023,00189545,17393,19399359,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2023.3267479
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3265207,2D LiDAR Based Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Target Path Planning in Unknown Environment,"Global path planning techniques have been widely employed in solving path planning problems, however they have been found to be unsuitable for unknown environments. Contrarily, the traditional Q-learning method, which is a common reinforcement learning approach for local path planning, is unable to complete the task for multiple targets. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a modified Q-learning method, called Vector Field Histogram based Q-learning (VFH-QL) utilized the VFH information in state space representation and reward function, based on a 2D LiDAR sensor. We compared the performance of our proposed method with the classical Q-learning method (CQL) through training experiments that were conducted in a simulated environment with a size of 400 square pixels, representing a 20-meter square map. The environment contained static obstacles and a single mobile robot. Two experiments were conducted: experiment A involved path planning for a single target, while experiment B involved path planning for multiple targets. The results of experiment A showed that VFH-QL method had 87.06% less training time and 99.98% better obstacle avoidance compared to CQL. In experiment B, VFH-QL method was found to have an average training time that was 95.69% less than that of the CQL method and 83.99% better path quality. The VFH-QL method was then evaluated using a benchmark dataset. The results indicated that the VFH-QL exhibited superior path quality, with efficiency of 94.89% and improvements of 96.91% and 96.69% over CQL and SARSA in the task of path planning for multiple targets in unknown environments.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Access,mobile robot | path planning | Q-learning | RL,2-s2.0-85153360184,,,Article,Abdalmanan N.,60090652,Universiti Malaysia Perlis,Arau,Malaysia,7,"Abdalmanan, Nasr;Kamarudin, Kamarulzaman;Bakar, Muhammad Aizat Abu;Rahiman, Mohd Hafiz Fazalul;Zakaria, Ammar;Mamduh, Syed Muhammad;Kamarudin, Latifah Munirah",58198308900;55193266400;57190940268;16175792400;36560557700;55193486100;57192974774,60090652;60090652;60090652;60090652;60090652;60090652;60090652,2023,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,11,,,35541-35555,1,MOHE,9002-00094/9028-00002,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia",0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3265207
10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3262109,Adaptive Hybrid Optimization Learning-Based Accurate Motion Planning of Multi-Joint Arm,"Motion planning is important to the automatic operation of the manipulator. It is difficult for traditional motion planning algorithms to achieve efficient online motion planning in a rapidly changing environment and high-dimensional planning space. The neural motion planning (NMP) algorithm based on reinforcement learning provides a new way to solve the above-mentioned task. Aiming to overcome the difficulty of training the neural network in high-accuracy planning tasks, this article proposes to combine the artificial potential field (APF) method and reinforcement learning. The neural motion planner can avoid obstacles in a wide range; meanwhile, the APF method is exploited to adjust the partial position. Considering that the action space of the manipulator is high-dimensional and continuous, the soft-actor-critic (SAC) algorithm is adopted to train the neural motion planner. By training and testing with different accuracy values in a simulation engine, it is verified that, in the high-accuracy planning tasks, the success rate of the proposed hybrid method is better than using the two algorithms alone. Finally, the feasibility of directly transferring the learned neural network to the real manipulator is verified by a dynamic obstacle-avoidance task.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,Artificial potential field (APF) | Heuristic algorithms | hybrid dynamic strategy | Manipulator dynamics | manipulator motion planning | Manipulators | Planning | Reinforcement learning | reinforcement learning | Task analysis | Training,2-s2.0-85153356019,,37027270,Article,Bai C.,60019616;60008592,Harbin Institute of Technology;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,Harbin;Hong Kong,China;Hong Kong,4,"Bai, Chengchao;Zhang, Jiawei;Guo, Jifeng;Yue, C.

However, to fully supplement human effort, these robots will need low-latency, reliable connectivity throughout the work zone through links established by wireless access points (APs). This will allow the robot to assuredly respond to programming directives that rely on the real-time relaying of robot-generated sensor data to the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server. In this paper, we propose L-NORM, a multi-AP and multi-robot coordination framework, as a multi-tiered solution for such autonomous edge networks. First, multi-robot motion planning through reinforcement learning occurs at the MEC, using as input multi-modal robot sensor data. Second, multi-AP resource orchestration is performed using another reinforcement learning-based method that maps a subset of available APs to each robot toward meeting their sensor data delivery requirements. Furthermore, we suggest diversity combination of uplink channels with the 802.11ax scheduled access mode that will (i) support high reliability of multi-robot uplink sensor packets and (ii) enable multi-AP coordination, for optimized resource utilization.

Objective: We introduce the CS Interests and Beliefs Inventory (CSIBI), an instrument designed for novice secondary students to learn by designing projects (particularly with physical computing). The inventory contains subscales on beliefs on problem solving competency, fascination in design, value of CS, creative expression, and beliefs about context-specific CS abilities alongside programming mindsets and outcomes. We explain the creation of the instrument and attend to the role of mindsets as mediators of self-beliefs and how CSIBI may be adapted to other K-12 project-based learning settings. Method: We administered the instrument to 303 novice CS secondary students who largely came from historically marginalized backgrounds (gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status). We assessed the nine-factor structure for the 32-item instrument using confirmatory factor analysis and tested the hypothesized model of mindsets as mediators with structural equation modeling. Findings: We confirmed the nine-factor structure of CSIBI and found significant positive correlations across factors. The structural model results showed that problem solving competency beliefs and CS creative expression promoted programming growth mindset, which subsequently fostered students’ programming self-concept. Implications: We validated an instrument to measure secondary students’ self-beliefs in CS that fills several gaps in K-12 CS measurement tools by focusing on contexts of learning by designing.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has the potential to make robots attain this capability. In this paper, we propose an affordance-based human-robot interaction (HRI) framework, aiming to reduce the action space size that would considerably impede the exploration efficiency of the agent. The framework is based on a new algorithm called Contextual Q-learning (CQL). We first show that the proposed algorithm trains in a reduced amount of time (2.7 seconds) and reaches an 84% of success rate. This suits the robot's learning efficiency to observe the current scenario configuration and learn to solve it. Then, we empirically validate the framework for implementation in HRI real-world scenarios. During the HRI, the robot uses semantic information from the state and the optimal policy of the last training step to search for relevant changes in the environment that may trigger the generation of a new policy.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Access,affordances | human-robot interaction | Q-learning | robot learning | robotics,2-s2.0-85151559006,,,Article,Munguia-Galeano F.,60023998;60020661,Cardiff University;University of Liverpool,Cardiff;Liverpool,United Kingdom;United Kingdom,5,"Munguia-Galeano, Francisco;Veeramani, Satheeshkumar;Hernandez, Juan David;Wen, Qingmeng;Ji, Ze",57993063100;56167487900;56742631800;58169143600;36181378200,60023998;60020661;60023998;60023998;60023998,2023,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,11,,,31282-31292,1,,undefined,,1,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3262450

Many techniques are present in literature, but most of them require analytical models with a lot of equations that are time consuming, hard to resolve, and not so easy to handle. For this reason, the help of a soft mechanics simulator is essential in this field. This article presents a tutorial on how to build a soft-robot model using an open source finite element analysis (FEA) simulator, called SOFA. This software is able to generate a simulation scene from a code written in Python or XML, so it can be used by people with different fields of competence, like mechanical knowledge, knowledge of material properties, and programming skills. As a case study, a Python simulation of a cable-driven soft actuator that makes contact with a rigid object is considered. The basic working principles of SOFA required to make a scene are explained step by step. In particular, this article shows how to simulate the mechanics and animate the bending behavior of the actuator and the importance of knowledge of the constitutive material properties for good modeling of the mechanical system.

This article introduces a method for ensuring the safety of learned models for control using differentiable control barrier functions (dCBFs). dCBFs are end-to-end trainable and guarantee safety. They improve over classical control barrier functions (CBFs), which are usually overly conservative. Our dCBF solution relaxes the CBF definitions by: 1) using environmental dependencies; 2) embedding them into differentiable quadratic programs. These novel safety layers are called a BarrierNet. They can be used in conjunction with any neural network-based controller. They are trained by gradient descent. With BarrierNet, the safety constraints of a neural controller become adaptable to changing environments. We evaluate BarrierNet on the following several problems: 1) robot traffic merging; 2) robot navigation in 2-D and 3-D spaces; 3) end-to-end vision-based autonomous driving in a sim-to-real environment and in physical experiments; 4) demonstrate their effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,Autonomous vehicles | Control barrier function (CBF) | neural networks | Neural networks | robot learning | Robot sensing systems | Robots | Safety | safety guarantees | Uncertainty | Vehicle dynamics,2-s2.0-85151489417,,,Article,Xiao W.,60006320,MIT Computer Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,Cambridge,United States,7,"Xiao, Wei;Wang, Tsun Hsuan;Hasani, Ramin;Chahine, Makram;Amini, Alexander;Li, Xiao;Rus, Daniela",57209134136;57353547300;57191608970;57557903600;56421607600;57206744129;57218886083,60006320;60006320;60006320;60006320;60006320;60006320;60006320,2023,15523098,95101,19410468,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,1,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2023.3249564

Due to the variation in models and service procedures, numerous lithium-ion battery brands, models, and retirement states exist. This uncertainty contributes to the complexity of the disassembly procedure, which calls for a great deal of adaptability. Human–Robot Collaboration Disassembly (HRCD) mode maximizes the advantages of both humans and robots, progressively replacing single-person disassembly and single-machine disassembly to become the standard method for disassembling end-of-life lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the HRCD process has more dimensions and uncertainties. In light of the obstacles above, this paper developed an HRCD environment with virtual and real interaction functions, which recommended real-time cooperation strategies in the dynamic production process and significantly enhanced the flexibility of disassembly operations. Based on the genetic algorithm (GA), the Disassembly Sequence Planning (DSP) is developed for waste LIBs in the source domain and imported into the knowledge base. Then, the rapid adaptive generation of HRCD task strategy for LIBs is generated, utilizing the transfer learning approach in the target domain. Two types of end-of-life automobile LIBs are analyzed as case study products. The results demonstrated that the proposed method could plan an effective action sequence, effectively reduce the design time of the target domain disassembly strategy, and enhance the flexibility of HRCD.",ar,2023-01-01,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,Digital twin | Disassembly sequence planning | Human–robot collaboration | Transfer learning,2-s2.0-85151481774,,,Article,Qu W.,60010953,Donghua University,Shanghai,China,5,"Qu, Weibin;Li, Jie;Zhang, Rong;Liu, Shimin;Bao, Jinsong",58167804800;57210125923;57222149011;57204846684;7201398425,60010953;60010953;60010953;60010953;60010953,2023,09565515,24363,15728145,Journal,,,,,0,DHU,CUSF-DH-D-2022072,Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10845-023-02081-9

The multiple DOF manipulator is required to plan its path and grasping pose in order to achieve handling and human–machine cooperation in a complex environment. This paper proposes a novel framework for motion planning of the manipulator using deep reinforcement learning integrated with transfer learning. We transfer the strategy of path planning to the complex task of grasping pose by using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) in an environment with obstacles. DDPG integrated with transfer learning is used to plan the path of NAO robot’s right arm and grasping pose in an environment with obstacles. The strategy of path planning using the DDPG algorithm is transferred to the learning process of grasping pose in the obstacle environment. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can avoid obstacles effectively when the manipulator plans grasping pose.

As regulation demands arose worldwide, controling and reacting to unauthorized flights of UAVs became a pressing issue. In this work, we present an algorithm to accelerate the training of a reinforcement learning drone agent for a counter unmanned aerial system (C-UAS). The main objective of this C-UAS is to guide an invading drone to a safe-killing zone (SZ) using a hunter quadrotor drone. The hunter quadrotor launches a spoofing, or meaconing, attack on the GNSS receiver of the invading drone. The proposed algorithms employ an abstraction of the C-UAS problem to accelerate the training step and enable training during the mission. Results for different SZ radii are discussed using a software-in-the-loop simulation for ground truth based on a detailed model of the UAV embedded system and flight dynamics, including error metrics and action time.

In this article, we present Real-time planning using Linear Spatial Separations, or RLSS: a real-time decentralized trajectory planning algorithm for cooperative multi-robot teams in static environments. The algorithm requires relatively few robot capabilities, namely sensing the positions of robots and obstacles without higher-order derivatives and the ability of distinguishing robots from obstacles. There is no communication requirement and the robots’ dynamic limits are taken into account. RLSS generates and solves convex quadratic optimization problems that are kinematically feasible and guarantees collision avoidance if the resulting problems are feasible. We demonstrate the algorithm’s performance in real-time in simulations and on physical robots.

To address this challenge, this article proposes a real-time, hybrid neuromorphic framework for object tracking and classification using event-based cameras that possess desirable properties such as low-power consumption (5&#x2013;14 mW) and high dynamic range (120 dB). Nonetheless, unlike traditional approaches of using event-by-event processing, this work uses a mixed frame and event approach to get energy savings with high performance. Using a frame-based region proposal method based on the density of foreground events, a hardware-friendly object tracking scheme is implemented using the apparent object velocity while tackling occlusion scenarios. The frame-based object track input is converted back to spikes for TrueNorth (TN) classification via the energy-efficient deep network (EEDN) pipeline. Using originally collected datasets, we train the TN model on the hardware track outputs, instead of using ground truth object locations as commonly done, and demonstrate the ability of our system to handle practical surveillance scenarios. As an alternative tracker paradigm, we also propose a continuous-time tracker with C<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$++$</tex-math> </inline-formula> implementation where each event is processed individually, which better exploits the low latency and asynchronous nature of neuromorphic vision sensors. Subsequently, we extensively compare the proposed methodologies to state-of-the-art event-based and frame-based methods for object tracking and classification, and demonstrate the use case of our neuromorphic approach for real-time and embedded applications without sacrificing performance.

A narrow road is any space in which the robot cannot move without turning around. Conventional path planning techniques ignore turnabout points and directions determined by environmental data, which might result in collisions or deadlocks on a narrow road. The proposed method uses the Deep Q-network (DQN) to obtain a control strategy for path planning on narrow roads. In the simulation, the robot learned the optimal velocity commands that maximized the long-term reward. The reward is designed to reach a target with a smaller change in robot velocity and fewer turnabouts. The success rate and the number of turnabouts in the simulation and experiment were used to evaluate the trained model.

In recent years, there have been several attempts to develop soft wearable devices for supporting human-robot interfaces. Many algorithms and programming languages are available to integrate a wearable device with a soft robot. One such promising algorithm is reservoir computing (RC), which includes of a group of recurrently and randomly connected nodes. The RC model can easily process multidimensional signal data and can handle nonlineardata and has been extensively used in robotic control. It has been reported that the RC algorithm can speed up network training and solve complex data sets. However, the main existing limitations in hand-locomotion classification are the considerable run-time and the delayed response. In this study, we figure out the best machine learning algorithms to handle three-dimensional hand-gesture data. We employ a two-part strategy: a loopback filter is included in the preprocessing of the initial dataset to support the 3-dimensional (3D) signs of each hand posture; subsequently, the training dataset is applied to the machine learning algorithm which includes an artificial neural network (ANN), convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory(LSTM), and reservoir computing(RC). Each training network is optimized with various hyperparameters. Furthermore, we compare the performance of several machine-learning algorithms in classifying the three-dimensional hand-signal posture data. The results show that the classification of nonlinear hand-locomotion signals by RC requires a comparatively shorter training duration (12 minutes for training times), and that optimal accuracy 94.17, precision 94.10, and recall 93.99 is realized for time series data.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Access,and nonlinear data | Human - machine interface | human hand-locomotion signal | multi dimension | reservoir computing | time series,2-s2.0-85149361343,,,Article,Witchuda T.,60069380;60031126;60011944,Universitas Gadjah Mada;Tokyo Institute of Technology;Shibaura Institute of Technology,Yogyakarta;Tokyo;Tokyo,Indonesia;Japan;Japan,4,"Witchuda, Thongking;Wiranata, Ardi;Maeda, Shingo;Premachandra, Chinthaka",58133412200;57190937749;8871390600;25926589200,60011944;60069380;60031126;60011944,2023,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,11,,,19591-19601,1,KAKEN,18H05473,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,1,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3247631

Generating multiple plausible trajectories is convenient in applications such as the manipulation of a robot arm by enabling the selection of trajectories that avoids collision with the robot or surrounding environment. In the proposed method, various trajectories that avoid obstacles can be generated by connecting the start and goal state with arbitrary line segments in this generated latent space. Our method provides this collision-free latent space, after which any planner, using any optimization conditions, can be used to generate the most suitable paths on the fly. We successfully verified this method with a simulated and actual UR5e 6-DoF robotic arm. We confirmed that different trajectories could be generated depending on optimization conditions.",ar,2023-01-01,Advanced Robotics,cGANs | learning from experience | Learning-based collision-free planning | representation learning,2-s2.0-85149033382,,,Article,Ando T.,60120917;60112222;60024621;60023462,"Preferred Networks, Inc.;SoftBank Group Corp.;National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology;Waseda University",Tokyo;Tokyo;Tsukuba;Tokyo,Japan;Japan;Japan;Japan,8,"Ando, Tomoki;Iino, Hiroto;Mori, Hiroki;Torishima, Ryota;Takahashi, Kuniyuki;Yamaguchi, Shoichiro;Okanohara, Daisuke;Ogata, Tetsuya",57462252400;57540796500;36615819400;57462193000;57207883472;57216194134;8912809200;7402000772,60023462-60024621;60023462-60024621;60024621-60023462;60112222;60120917;60120917;60120917;60023462-60024621,2023,01691864,18003,15685535,Journal,37,10,,621-633,0,,undefined,,0,2023,https://doi.org/10.1080/01691864.2023.2180327

The mobile robot runs autonomously based on the path of the marker. How-ever, as the conventional method uses OpenCV to identify the shape of the marker using the color information of the marker, the marker may be misrecognized owing to the influence of light. Furthermore, the spec-ifications of the camera limit the detection distance of the marker placed opposite it, which inevitably lim-its the straight traveling distance of the mobile robot in the proposed method. The proposed method im-proves the accuracy of marker recognition by using deep learning, and also devises the method of placing markers that allows the user to move straight ahead over a longer distance. It can also easily achieve autonomous path travel control, including long-distance straight lines, for a mobile robot in an environment where global positioning systems (GPS) cannot be re-ceived. In addition, the system can be easily operated by an actual user, who need not have any knowledge of programming, because the travel path of the mobile robot can be set up simply by placing markers.

10.1109/TCDS.2023.3242373,Obstacle Avoidance Learning for Robot Motion Planning in Human-Robot Integration Environments,"In the human-robot integration environment, it is essential for mobile robots to pass through the crowd and complete the navigation task smoothly. However, the current mainstream robot navigation algorithms only treat pedestrians as dynamic obstacles and passively avoid pedestrians in local planning. When encountering fast-moving pedestrians, local path planning often fails, causing the robot to stagnate, spin or shake in place, which in turn reduces the navigation efficiency and results in unnatural navigation trajectories. To address this problem, it is desirable for the robot to find a safe and convenient temporary target to avoid the collision with fast-moving pedestrians. In this paper, we propose an obstacle avoidance learning method with the temporary target for the robot motion planning in the human-robot integration environment. The temporary target distribution is learned from imitations by using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) framework, whereby the dynamic scenario information including pedestrian information, the environmental information, and the robot information are considered as the generation conditions. With the proposed method, the mobile robot first navigates to the temporary target area, and then plans the path toward the final target point.

The problem becomes critical on embedded devices, where computational and memory resources are strictly constrained. Compilers play an essential role in deploying source code on a target device through the backend. In this work, a novel backend for the Open Neural Network Compiler (ONNC) is proposed, which exploits machine learning to optimize code for the ARM Cortex-M device. The backend requires minimal changes to Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) models. Several novel optimization techniques are also incorporated in the backend, such as quantizing the ONNX model's weight and automatically tuning the dimensions of operators in computations. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated for two applications: handwritten digit recognition on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset and model, and image classification on the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research and 10 (CIFAR-10) dataset with the AlexNet-Light model. The system achieves 98.90% and 90.55% accuracy for handwritten digit recognition and image classification, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed architecture is significantly more lightweight than other state-of-theart models in terms of both computation time and generated source code complexity.

This problem models many multirobot routing tasks, such as exploring unknown environments and information gathering for environmental monitoring.

In particular, we show that the algorithm yields a: 1) constant-factor approximation when the cost function is modular; 2) <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\log$</tex-math></inline-formula> factor approximation when the cost function is submodular; and 3) constant-factor approximation when the cost function is submodular, but the robots are allowed to exceed their path budgets by a bounded amount.

10.1109/TASE.2023.3233949,Untangling Multiple Deformable Linear Objects in Unknown Quantities With Complex Backgrounds,"The manipulation of deformable objects, especially deformable linear objects (DLOs), represents an open challenge in robotics. The keys to solving the problem are accurately recognizing the topological model describing the entwined state of DLO(s) and a manipulation strategy based on it. The situation becomes more challenging in practical applications since the DLO(s) may be placed under complex and unencountered environments, making distinguishing between the targets and the background difficult. In addition, with the information obtained from a sensor system with a limited field of sense, a robot has to treat the encountered DLO(s) as multiple ones of an unknown quantity. This paper proposes a solution based on deep learning techniques for these complicated scenarios. The approach can derive a topological model describing the entangled structure of single or multiple DLOs. Based on the model, we proposed a strategy for untangling the DLO(s), considering both the possible self-tangling in one DLO and the tangling between multiple DLOs. The strategy ensures that the entangled DLO(s) can be arranged to be the neatest state given a limited field of view. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution were verified by untangling experiments utilizing a dual-arm robot system. Even if the exact quantity of the DLO(s) is unknown, the robots can still untangle the DLO(s). Moreover, the proposed approach performed robustness to unfamiliar background textures, which is preferable in practical applications. Dataset used in this paper can be found at https://github.com/lancexz/dlos-dataset. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;This article proposes an automatic solution for untangling an unknown quantity of DLO(s) using robots. Issues concerned with complex backgrounds, an unknown quantity of DLOs, and limits of field of view, which are easily encountered in practical applications, are solved. Experiments demonstrated the feasibility and robustness of the approach in different scenarios. Potential applications for the proposed method include pipeline bin-picking tasks, rope-like object manipulation in household robots, and cable assembly in industrial areas. Moreover, the topological state recognition process can also be utilized in knot-tying studies and producing datasets. As the current system can not deal with scenes where DLO segments or crossings severely overlap, practitioners should integrate real-time tracking, deformation control method, and unqualified cases detection to avoid the appearance of such cases during manipulation.

In the process of centralized training, the value network is used to evaluate and optimize the policy network to achieve multi-agent cooperation, and the attention mechanism is introduced into the policy network to realize information sharing among multiple tasks. In the process of decentralized execution, each agent performs multiple task decisions through local observations according to the trained policy network. Then, observation, action, and reward are designed. Rewards include global and local rewards, which are decomposed into sub-rewards corresponding to tasks.

Existing methods still face the problem that detection efficiency and accuracy cannot be achieved at the same time. In this paper, we introduce artificial intelligence technology into the control system. Based on the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) algorithm, we generated a dataset and trained a deep neural network (DLNet) to improve the detection efficiency. By combining DLNet and the GJK algorithm, we propose a two-level self-collision detection algorithm (DLGJK algorithm) to solve real-time self-collision detection problems in a dual-manipulator system with fast-continuous and high-precision properties. First, the proposed algorithm uses DLNet to determine whether the current working state of the system has a risk of self-collision; since most of the working states in a system workspace do not have a self-collision risk, DLNet can effectively reduce the number of unnecessary detections and improve the detection efficiency. Then, for the working states with a risk of self-collision, we modeled precise colliders and applied the GJK algorithm for fine self-collision detection, which achieved detection accuracy. The experimental results showed that compared to that with the global use of the GJK algorithm for self-collision detection, the DLGJK algorithm can reduce the time expectation of a single detection in a system workspace by 97.7%. In the path planning of the manipulators, it could effectively reduce the number of unnecessary detections, improve the detection efficiency, and reduce system overhead. The proposed algorithm also has good scalability for a multi-manipulator system that can be split into dual-manipulator systems.",ar,2023-01-01,Sensors,artificial intelligence | deep neural network | dual-manipulator system | GJK algorithm | self-collision detection,2-s2.0-85145979687,,36617121,Article,Wu D.,60004538,Dalian University of Technology,Dalian,China,4,"Wu, Di;Yu, Zhi;Adili, Alimasi;Zhao, Fanchen",57044207100;58054986400;58055201200;58054776200,60004538;60004538;60004538;60004538,January 2023,14248220,130124,,Journal,23,1,523,,1,DUT,XM01006,Dalian University of Technology,2,2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/s23010523

10.3390/s23010383,Hyperspectral Imaging for Mobile Robot Navigation,"The article presents the application of a hyperspectral camera in mobile robot navigation. Hyperspectral cameras are imaging systems that can capture a wide range of electromagnetic spectra. This feature allows them to detect a broader range of colors and features than traditional cameras and to perceive the environment more accurately. Several surface types, such as mud, can be challenging to detect using an RGB camera. In our system, the hyperspectral camera is used for ground recognition (e.g., grass, bumpy road, asphalt). Traditional global path planning methods take the shortest path length as the optimization objective. We propose an improved A* algorithm to generate the collision-free path. Semantic information makes it possible to plan a feasible and safe path in a complex off-road environment, taking traveling time as the optimization objective. We presented the results of the experiments for data collected in a natural environment. An important novelty of this paper is using a modified nearest neighbor method for hyperspectral data analysis and then using the data for path planning tasks in the same work. Using the nearest neighbor method allows us to adjust the robotic system much faster than using neural networks. As our system is continuously evolving, we intend to examine the performance of the vehicle on various road surfaces, which is why we sought to create a classification system that does not require a prolonged learning process.

10.1109/LRA.2022.3226030,Gaussian Radar Transformer for Semantic Segmentation in Noisy Radar Data,"Scene understanding is crucial for autonomous robots in dynamic environments for making future state predictions, avoiding collisions, and path planning. Camera and LiDAR perception made tremendous progress in recent years, but face limitations under adverse weather conditions. To leverage the full potential of multi-modal sensor suites, radar sensors are essential for safety critical tasks and are already installed in most new vehicles today. In this letter, we address the problem of semantic segmentation of moving objects in radar point clouds to enhance the perception of the environment with another sensor modality. Instead of aggregating multiple scans to densify the point clouds, we propose a novel approach based on the self-attention mechanism to accurately perform sparse, single-scan segmentation. Our approach, called Gaussian Radar Transformer, includes the newly introduced Gaussian transformer layer, which replaces the softmax normalization by a Gaussian function to decouple the contribution of individual points. To tackle the challenge of the transformer to capture long-range dependencies, we propose our attentive up- and downsampling modules to enlarge the receptive field and capture strong spatial relations.

10.1016/j.artint.2022.103811,Sim-to-Lab-to-Real: Safe reinforcement learning with shielding and generalization guarantees,"Safety is a critical component of autonomous systems and remains a challenge for learning-based policies to be utilized in the real world. In particular, policies learned using reinforcement learning often fail to generalize to novel environments due to unsafe behavior. In this paper, we propose Sim-to-Lab-to-Real to bridge the reality gap with a probabilistically guaranteed safety-aware policy distribution. To improve safety, we apply a dual policy setup where a performance policy is trained using the cumulative task reward and a backup (safety) policy is trained by solving the Safety Bellman Equation based on Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis. In Sim-to-Lab transfer, we apply a supervisory control scheme to shield unsafe actions during exploration; in Lab-to-Real transfer, we leverage the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-Bayes framework to provide lower bounds on the expected performance and safety of policies in unseen environments. Additionally, inheriting from the HJ reachability analysis, the bound accounts for the expectation over the worst-case safety in each environment. We empirically study the proposed framework for ego-vision navigation in two types of indoor environments with varying degrees of photorealism. We also demonstrate strong generalization performance through hardware experiments in real indoor spaces with a quadrupedal robot.

For this purpose, over-the-air computing (AirComp) is a promising technique for ultra low-latency wireless data aggregation, enabled by the waveform superposition properties of a multiple access channel. In this letter, the synergy of decentralized AirComp, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and machine learning is proposed, to transform the wireless environment to intelligent AirComp environment (IACE), i.e., with inherent and advanced capabilities to perform computations in a fully decentralized way at the physical layer. Specifically, we minimize the AirComp error, i.e., the average mean-square errors of devices with respect to a target function, by jointly optimizing the RIS phase-shift vector and the transmission and reception scaling factors of devices. Also, to solve this challenging problem, we propose an online deep neural network (DNN) optimization approach.

However, path planning and navigation obstacle avoidance among multiple robots, as well as dynamic environments, raise significant challenges. We propose a distributed multi-mobile robot navigation and obstacle avoidance method in unknown environments. First, we propose a bidirectional alternating jump point search A* algorithm (BAJPSA*) to obtain the robot’s global path in the prior environment and further improve the heuristic function to enhance efficiency. We construct a robot kinematic model based on the dynamic window approach (DWA), present an adaptive navigation strategy, and introduce a new path tracking evaluation function that improves path tracking accuracy and optimality. To strengthen the security of obstacle avoidance, we modify the decision rules and obstacle avoidance rules of the single robot and further improve the decision avoidance capability of multi-robot systems. Moreover, the mainstream prioritization method is used to coordinate the local dynamic path planning of our multi-robot systems to resolve collision conflicts, reducing the difficulty of obstacle avoidance and simplifying the algorithm. Experimental results show that this distributed multi-mobile robot motion planning method can provide better navigation and obstacle avoidance strategies in complex dynamic environments, which provides a technical reference in practical situations.",ar,2023-01-01,Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering,A* algorithm | distributed multi-mobile robots | dynamic window approach | path planning | prioritization method,2-s2.0-85140913034,,36650761,Article,Yang Z.,60020675,Kunming University of Science and Technology,Kunming,China,6,"Yang, Zhen;Li, Junli;Yang, Liwei;Wang, Qian;Li, Ping;Xia, Guofeng",57874061500;57873150400;57338252400;57195430659;57337797900;57873522000,60020675;60020675;60020675;60020675;60020675;60020675,2023,15471063,5200152802,15510018,Journal,20,1,,145-178,1,NKRDPC,61163051,National Key Research and Development Program of China,2,2023,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2023008

10.1016/j.cpc.2022.108527,JAX-Fluids: A fully-differentiable high-order computational fluid dynamics solver for compressible two-phase flows,"Physical systems are governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The Navier-Stokes equations describe fluid flows and are representative of nonlinear physical systems with complex spatio-temporal interactions. Fluid flows are omnipresent in nature and engineering applications, and their accurate simulation is essential for providing insights into these processes. While PDEs are typically solved with numerical methods, the recent success of machine learning (ML) has shown that ML methods can provide novel avenues of finding solutions to PDEs. ML is becoming more and more present in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). However, up to this date, there does not exist a general-purpose ML-CFD package which provides 1) powerful state-of-the-art numerical methods, 2) seamless hybridization of ML with CFD, and 3) automatic differentiation (AD) capabilities. AD in particular is essential to ML-CFD research as it provides gradient information and enables optimization of preexisting and novel CFD models. In this work, we propose JAX-Fluids: a comprehensive fully-differentiable CFD Python solver for compressible two-phase flows. JAX-Fluids is intended for ML-supported CFD research. The framework allows the simulation of complex fluid dynamics with phenomena like three-dimensional turbulence, compressibility effects, and two-phase flows. Written entirely in JAX, it is straightforward to include existing ML models into the proposed framework. Furthermore, JAX-Fluids enables end-to-end optimization. I.e., ML models can be optimized with gradients that are backpropagated through the entire CFD algorithm, and therefore contain not only information of the underlying PDE but also of the applied numerical methods. We believe that a Python package like JAX-Fluids is crucial to facilitate research at the intersection of ML and CFD and may pave the way for an era of differentiable fluid dynamics.

Nature of problem: The compressible Navier-Stokes equations describe continuum-scale fluid flows. These flows often involve highly complex flow phenomena such as shocks, material interfaces, and turbulence. The intrinsic nonlinear dynamics render the numerical simulation of the these equations challenging. Machine learning provides novel avenues for describing partial differential equations. Machine learning models rely on gradient information provided by automatic differentiation and are often implemented in Python. In contrast, existing high-performance computational fluid dynamics codes are typically written in Fortran or C++ and do not offer inherent automatic differentiation capabilities. These discrepancies hinder the advance of machine-learning-supported computational fluid dynamics. Up to this day, a general-purpose fully-differentiable computational fluid dynamics solver for compressible two-phase flows is missing. Solution method: We introduce JAX-Fluids: a general-purpose three-dimensional fully-differentiable computational fluid dynamics solver for compressible two-phase flows. JAX-Fluids is a simulation framework intended for machine-learning-supported computational fluid dynamics research. Our framework is written entirely in JAX, a high-performance numerical computing library with automatic differentiation capabilities. We have used an object-oriented programming style and a modular design philosophy. This allows the straightforward exchange of numerical methods. We provide a wide variety of state-of-the-art high-order computational methods for compressible flows. The modularity of our framework additionally facilitates the integration of custom subroutines. We use the sharp-interface level-set method to model two-phase flows. The software package can easily be installed as a Python package. We have build the source code around the JAX NumPy API. This makes JAX-Fluids accessible and performant. JAX-Fluids runs on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. We use HDF5 in combination with XDMF for writing output quantities. The Python packages Haiku and Optax are used for implementation and training of machine learning methods. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: JAX-Fluids relies on open-source third-party Python libraries. These are automatically installed. In the current version, JAX-Fluids only runs on a single accelerator (CPU/GPU/TPU). Future versions will include support for parallel execution.

In this article, we present our approach model-based reinforcement learning for spacecraft rendezvous guidance (MBRL4SRG). We build a Markov decision process model based on the Clohessy-Wiltshire equation of spacecraft dynamics and use dynamic programming to solve it and generate the decision table as the optimal agent policy. Since the onboard computing system of spacecraft is resource constrained in terms of both memory size and processing speed, we train a neural network (NN) as a compact and efficient function approximation to the tabular representation of the decision table. The NN outputs are formally verified using the verification tool ReluVal, and the verification results show that the robustness of the NN is maintained.

10.1109/TASE.2022.3162653,A Dynamic Scheduling Framework for Byproduct Gas System Combining Expert Knowledge and Production Plan,"Effective scheduling for byproduct gas systems of steel industry is becoming increasingly vital for maintaining their safe operating and improving energy utilization. Considering that the existing studies failed to capture the dynamic changes in the production environment, a novel dynamic scheduling framework is proposed that seamingly integrates expert knowledge with a dynamic programming process. Given the phase characteristics of the steelmaking processes, data series are first partitioned into information granules based on the production plan to form the knowledge-based initial policies. To achieve dynamic scheduling process, a two-stage value function approximation method is proposed, where in the first stage one learns an event-driven Q-function by the fuzzy rule-based states, and then an action fitting strategy is developed for evaluating continuous actions. Considering the difficulties of establishing a mechanism-based model, the state transition process is described by a granular prediction model to simulate taking actions. On their basis, a dynamic compensation for the initial policies is finally achieved. A number of comparative experiments are conducted by utilizing the practical data coming from a steel plant. The results show that the proposed method can deliver effective solutions for long-term scheduling scenarios. Note to Practitioners - Given that the steelmaking process is a discontinuous one and the byproduct gas system can hardly be described by a physical or mechanism-based model, its energy scheduling works is usually performed by manual approach or using static optimization methods, which would lead to low accuracy and a waste of energy. Since a large number of real-time data had been accumulated by the SCADA system implemented in most steel plants, a data-driven dynamic scheduling approach is proposed in this study. The proposed method takes advantages of the expert knowledge and production plan data, and produces dynamic scheduling solutions by utilizing an actor-critic learning process. The application system on the basis of the proposed method can adapt to different scenarios and ensure long-term safety operations of the gas tanks. Furthermore, since there may be missing data or outliners in the acquired data collected by the SCADA onsite, it is necessary to perform data imputation and filtering methods to guarantee the data integrity and reliability. This study avoids the redundant introduction of such preliminary preprocessing methods for the sample data.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,byproduct gas system | Energy scheduling | granular computing | reinforcement learning | steel industry,2-s2.0-85128688180,,,Article,Wang T.,60030835;60005244;60004582;60004538;60001642,University of Alberta;Southeast University;King Abdulaziz University;Dalian University of Technology;Systems Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences,Edmonton;Nanjing;Jeddah;Dalian;Warsaw,Canada;China;Saudi Arabia;China;Poland,5,"Wang, Tianyu;Zhao, Jun;Xu, Qingshan;Pedrycz, Witold;Wang, Wei",57281947800;57188561419;14631248400;56854903200;57192615575,60004538;60004538;60005244;60030835-60004582-60001642;60004538,1 January 2023,15455955,17340,15583783,Journal,20,1,,541-552,0,NSFC,2018RJ01,National Natural Science Foundation of China,4,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2022.3162653
10.1109/TASE.2022.3150167,Dynamic Hypergames for Synthesis of Deceptive Strategies With Temporal Logic Objectives,"In this paper, we study the use of deception for strategic planning in adversarial environments. We model the interaction between the agent (player 1) and the adversary (player 2) as a two-player concurrent stochastic game in which the adversary has incomplete information about the agent's task specification given as a temporal logic formula. During the interaction, the adversary can infer the agent's intention from observations and adapt its strategy so as to prevent the agent from satisfying the objective. To plan against such an adaptive opponent, the agent must leverage its knowledge about the adversary's incomplete information to influence the behavior of the opponent, and thereby be deceptive. To synthesize a deceptive strategy, we introduce a class of hypergame models that capture the interaction between the agent and its adversary given asymmetric, incomplete information. We develop a solution concept for this class of hypergames and show that the subjectively rationalizable strategy for the agent is deceptive and maximizes the probability of satisfying the task in temporal logic. Such a deceptive strategy is obtained by modeling the opponent's evolving perception of the agent's objective and integrating it into planning. This allows the agent to manipulate the opponent's perception so as to induce the opponent into taking actions that benefit the agent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our deceptive planning algorithm using robot motion planning examples with temporal logic objectives and design a detection mechanism to notify the agent of potential errors in modeling the adversary's behavior. Note to Practitioners - Many security and defense applications employ deception mechanisms for strategic advantages. This work presents a game-theoretic framework for planning deceptive strategies in stochastic environments and shows that the opponent modeling plays a key role in the design of effective deception mechanisms. For applications to cyber-physical security, the practitioners can employ temporal logic for specifying security properties in the system and analyze defense with deception using the proposed methods.",ar,2023-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,deception | Hypergame | linear temporal logic | Markov decision processes,2-s2.0-85125325599,,,Article,Li L.,60013959;60011410,University of Florida;Worcester Polytechnic Institute,Gainesville;Worcester,United States;United States,4,"Li, Lening;Ma, Haoxiang;Kulkarni, Abhishek N.;Fu, Jie",57188689679;57219786502;57203656871;37121728900,60011410;60013959;60013959;60013959,1 January 2023,15455955,17340,15583783,Journal,20,1,,334-345,0,DARPA,HR00111990015,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,1,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2022.3150167

The core of the proposed method is based on a novel neural network model, i.e., graph wasserstein autoencoder (GraphWAE) network, which is used to represent the implicit sampling distributions of the configuration space (C-space) for sampling-based planning algorithms. Through learning the implicit distributions, we can guide the planning process to search or extend in the desired region to reduce the collision checks dramatically for fast and high-quality motion planning. The theoretical analysis and proofs are given to demonstrate the probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality of the proposed method. Numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through a series of planning problems from 2D, 6D and 12D robot C-spaces in the challenging scenes. Results indicate that the proposed method can achieve better planning performance than the state-of-the-art planning algorithms. Note to Practitioners - The motivation of this work is to develop a fast and high-quality asymptotically optimal motion planning method for practical applications such as autonomous driving, robotic manipulation and others. Due to the time consumption caused by collision detection, current planning algorithms usually take much time to converge to the optimal motion path especially in the complicated environment. In this paper, we present a neural network model based on GraphWAE to learn the biasing sampling distributions as the sample generation source to further reduce or avoid collision checks of sampling-based planning algorithms.
